PHI consumption is positively associated with financial development and cultural–social–economic factors, such as income, education, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation, whereas it is negatively associated with public health spending, masculinity, indulgence, and power distance. In addition, factors related to the health environment, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have a negative influence on PHI consumption in the selected OECD economies owing to losses in income. Our findings can serve as guidance for consumers and recommendations for health insurers and policymakers in designing health insurance policies and programs in developed and developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the understanding among scholars and practitioners has been that a portfolio of NPD projects is the expression of a firm's strategy and thus it must support the strategy. In keeping with this view, the current study focuses on new product development (NPD) portfolio planning, which is defined as a firm's effort to formulate portfolio decisions using a defined innovation strategy. Connecting portfolio decisions to a defined innovation strategy has been associated with higher innovation success. Surprisingly, empirical research indicates that portfolio decisions do not always support the company's innovation strategy. Furthermore, during recent years, an increasing number of authors underscore the importance of responsiveness and adaptability in portfolio decision-making. The current study addresses these two issues by examining a direct effect of decentralization in strategy-making on NPD portfolio planning, and a moderating effect of decentralization in strategy-making on the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. The study also examines the influence of national culture on the proposed relationships. The theoretical model was tested using data from the 2012 PDMA Comparative Performance Assessment Study. Findings indicate that NPD portfolio planning positively influences NPD program success. Also, results revealed inverted U-shaped direct and moderating effects, respectively, of decentralization in strategy-making on NPD portfolio planning, and of decentralization in strategy-making on the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. With regard to the moderating effect of national culture, results indicate that uncertainty avoidance does not moderate the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. Nonetheless, we found significant moderating effects of individualism and power distance on the curvilinear relationship between decentralization in strategy-making and NPD portfolio planning. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association},

Seen as probably the most difficult factors to change since it is grounded on practices performed over time, it should receive special attention. This article aims to analyze how culture can influence IT Governance implementation of structure, process and relational mechanisms in the context of higher education. Ten case studies in universities from three different countries: Brazil, Portugal and Netherlands were carried out. The purpose is the identification of relevant differences in IT Governance implementation among organizations from the following cultures: uncertainty avoidance and individualism.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a cross-sectional survey research design. Data were collected through 236 validly filled questionnaires by expatriates working in different industries in Nigeria. The research variables were measured using appropriate validated scales developed by different experts. Data collected were analyzed using frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to establish the relationships among the variables. Findings: The study found that the distance between expatriates’ home and Nigeria on each of the dimensions of cultural values: power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance cultural value, long-term orientation and indulgence negatively influence the psychological adjustment of the expatriates in Nigeria. The study demonstrated that the larger the distance between expatriates’ home and Nigeria's cultural values, the larger the difficulties in the psychological adjustment of expatriates in the country. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights and a better understanding to both present and future global human resource practitioners, multinational organizations, international institutions and local organizations operating in Nigeria with a global mindset on the cultural profiles of expatriates that are critical to adjust to working, social interactions and living environments in Nigeria. Originality/value: It provides practical guidance to global human resource practitioners and employers on dimensions of cultural values distance between Nigeria and the home countries of expatriates that should be considered when deciding on, searching for, selecting, recruiting and relocating expatriates to work and live in Nigeria. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The job demands–resources model is a dominant theoretical framework that describes the influence of job demands and job resources on employee strain. Recent research has highlighted that the effects of job demands on strain vary across cultures, but similar work has not explored whether this is true for job resources. Given that societal characteristics can influence individuals' cognitive structures and, to a lesser extent, values in a culture, we address this gap in the literature and argue that individuals' strain in reaction to job resources may differ across cultures. Specifically, we theorize that the societal cultural dimensions of individualism–collectivism and uncertainty avoidance shape individual-level job resource–strain relationships, as they dictate which types of resources (i.e., individual vs. group preference-oriented and uncertainty-reducing vs. not) are more likely to be valued, used, or effective in combating strain within a culture. Results revealed that societal individualism–collectivism and uncertainty avoidance independently moderated the relationships between certain job resources (i.e., job control, participation in decision making, and clear goals and performance feedback) and strain (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intentions). This study expands our understanding of the cross-cultural specificity versus generalizability of the job demands–resources model. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Organizational Behavior Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

However, the antecedents of employee self-leadership behaviors in the workplace have been underexplored in the literature, particularly in the context of the hospitality industry. Using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework, this study investigates a hypothesized moderated mediation model that includes the direct effects of organizational empowerment on self-leadership along with the conditional indirect effect of organizational empowerment on self-leadership through self-efficacy, as conditional on the level of employee uncertainty avoidance orientation. A questionnaire survey approach was used to collect data from a sample of 310 employees from 15 four-star and five-star hotels in Guangdong Province, the Southeast of Mainland China. The research results suggest that organization empowerment plays a positive role in enhancing self-leadership through the mediating effects of self-efficacy, with uncertainty avoidance moderating this positive indirect effect. Specifically, for people with low uncertainty avoidance the relationship is much stronger than for people with high uncertainty avoidance.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose is to identify the underlying motives of heavy work investment (HWI) types (i.e. workaholism and work engagement) based on self-determination theory, while controlling for job demands and resources. The role of four cultural differences (i.e. individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity) in moderating the motivational correlated relationships is also explored using data retrieved from two distinct cultures (i.e. the USA and Egypt). Design/methodology/approach: Full-time employees (N = 595) in the USA and Egypt were surveyed. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the associations between the two HWI types and four types of motivation (i.e. intrinsic, extrinsic, introjected and identified motivations). Furthermore, moderation analyses were conducted to explore potential effects of four cultural dimensions (i.e. individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity) on the motivationalcorrelated relationships. Findings: Workaholism positively relates to the controlled types of motivation (i.e. extrinsic and introjected regulation), while work engagement positively relates to the autonomous ones (i.e. intrinsic and identified regulation) and negatively associates with extrinsic motivation. Moreover, cultural masculinity moderated the relationship between work engagement and extrinsic motivation, as well as the association between workaholism and extrinsic motivation. Practical implications: A clear differentiation of motivation behind both types of HWI is required by occupational health practitioners to design interventions that stimulate employee engagement rather than fuel workaholism. Multinational organizations could also benefit from understanding the interaction between cultural dimensions, motives and HWI, thereby planning more effective work engagement strategies among different cultures. Originality/value: This is the first study to investigate the motivational correlates of HWI types across two contrasting cultures. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Applying the configurational approach, we conducted fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. We confirm the equal importance of both cultural and institutional mechanisms as contributors to national innovativeness, and identify equifinal configurations of cultural and institutional varieties as leading to a high-tech society.

	abstract = {Real options (RO) valuation has been promoted as a way to evaluate investment opportunities and make investment decisions that takes into account the value of managerial flexibility in the face of uncertainty. Although RO enjoys a substantial body of literature considering its application and suitability in different situations, the impact of national culture on the application of RO has received little attention. Values embedded in national culture affect the behavior of managers. In particular, these values play a role in how managers frame information, communicate, and make decisions, directly and indirectly affecting behavior through cultural layers such as organizational culture. National culture, therefore, can systematically affect the application of RO, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this article, we hypothesize how 2 particularly relevant dimensions of culture, power distance and uncertainty avoidance, affect RO exercise, and estimate the magnitude suboptimality of these effects using a model we develop for the case of a put option. Our estimates suggest RO may not always be a superior valuation approach to net present value for national cultures with certain characteristics. © 2018 The Institute of Behavioral Finance.},

	abstract = {Understanding the organizational culture when studying the information technology is critical as both influence each other on multiple levels. The culture plays an important role in the managerial decision making and directly influences the IT field. Each organization is based on three fundamental pillars: people, processes and technology, and this holistic model is largely accepted and used in modern present-day organizations. Multiple systems that control the organizational performance and which have as a main focus efficiency improvements of the organizational processes (ITIL, ERP, BI) are adopting this model. Understanding the relationships between people, processes and technology leads to identifying the optimal decisions that must be taken in order to achieve the strategic objectives of the organization. Organizational change - the capability to adapt to environmental transformations - is essential in today’s world and it is determining the survival capacity of the organization on the market. But the resistance to change is a big obstacle in this process and also in the case of adopting a new information technology that is influenced at the same time also by the political authority, rules and legislation, changes in the dynamic of the population and other factors. That is why we are considering that the relationship between the organizational culture and the way of adopting the IT elements can be analyzed by using the Geert Hofstede’s model of dimensions of national culture: power distance index, individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, uncertainty avoidance index, long term orientation versus short term normative orientation, indulgence versus restraint. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

	abstract = {Smiling individuals are usually perceived more favorably than non-smiling ones—they are judged as happier, more attractive, competent, and friendly. These seemingly clear and obvious consequences of smiling are assumed to be culturally universal, however most of the psychological research is carried out in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) and the influence of culture on social perception of nonverbal behavior is still understudied. Here we show that a smiling individual may be judged as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual in cultures low on the GLOBE’s uncertainty avoidance dimension. Furthermore, we show that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling—in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced. This research fosters understanding of the cultural framework surrounding nonverbal communication processes and reveals that in some cultures smiling may lead to negative attributions. © 2015, The Author(s).},

Two separate scenario-based experimental studies were conducted using non-student samples from two culturally diverse countries (Germany and India). Study 1 using 83 participants from Germany and 83 from India shows that when causal explanations for service failure are given, individualists have higher perceived justice. Study 2 with 81 participants from Germany and 82 from India shows that when cognitive control is given through regular updates during service recovery to high uncertainty avoidance seekers, they show higher perceived justice. The three independent justice dimensions positively influence recovery satisfaction, with informational justice showing the strongest impact, followed by procedural and distributive justice. This research thus contributes to the nascent literature in social media complaining. Managers of online service organizations can benefit from these findings when developing their complaint management strategies. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Service employees’ cultural values play an integral part in the service encounter. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether frontline employees’ (FLEs) individual cultural values moderate the relationship between service models and work behaviours and whether these behaviours influence their psychological well-being. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected online from 341 US and Indian respondents who spent at least 40 per cent of their work time interacting with customers. Cultural values were measured as individual-level constructs. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to test hypotheses. Findings: Individualism/collectivism significantly moderates the relationship between service models and work-related outcome, in particular organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB), while uncertainty avoidance does not. Collectivism strengthens the positive linkage between the win-win service model and OCB but weakens the association of OCB with the efficiency model. FLEs with the win-win model display more surface acting when they have low uncertainty avoidance and high power distance. Employee psychological well-being is then influenced negatively by surface acting, but positively by OCB. Research limitations/implications: A more varied sample covering additional countries and a wider range of industries could provide additional insights. Practical implications: The results of this study are particularly beneficial for service firms that require to satisfy customers by managing culturally diverse FLEs. Originality/value: Extending the limited research on service models, this study examines the interplay of culture and service models and its impact on FLE work behaviours and the resultant well-being. The findings thus provide greater insights in how service employees’ cultural orientations influence their work behaviours and psychological well-being. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Specifically, we develop a cross-cultural model to analyze the influence of organizational and national culture on cross-functional coopetition. Drawing on a dataset of 646 companies from seven countries, we theoretically advance and empirically validate the influence of organizational culture and the moderating role of individualism and uncertainty avoidance on cross-functional coopetition. Organizational cultural dimensions directly enhance cross-functional coopetition. Furthermore, strong social values of individualism and uncertainty avoidance weaken the relationship between organizational culture and cross-functional coopetition.

This research explores the relatively understudied influence of culture on individuals’ susceptibility to concepts derived from behavioral economics. Employing the Individual Cultural Values Scale (CVSCALE), we examine the impact of culture on the allure of choice, mental accounting, and overconfidence among 837 participants from Australia (AU), China (CN), Germany (GE), and the United States (US) through logistic regression analysis. At the individual level, discernible interactions between power–distance, allure of choice, and overconfidence are observed. On the national scale, power–distance (AU, US), uncertainty avoidance (US), and masculinity (CN) significantly impact the allure of choice, while overconfidence is influenced by power–distance (US) and masculinity (US). Our analysis shows that culture plays a pivotal role in shaping susceptibility to biases and heuristics, thereby influencing decision-making processes. The findings advocate for a culturally differentiated approach to behavioral economics, emphasizing the need to tailor strategies and interventions based on cultural nuances. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Current debates on organizational learning distinguish between two distinct and mutually exclusive learning modes: exploration and exploitation. This paper deals with the concept of ambidextrous routines in knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Specifically, drawing on a sample of 1468 MNEs from 24 regions in China, we find that a synergetic combination of explorative and exploitative virtual knowledge is positively associated with MNE performance. In contrast, an imbalance between explorative and exploitative virtual knowledge hurts MNE performance. Furthermore, the effect of imbalanced ambidexterity in virtual knowledge sharing is moderated by the cultural distance in the uncertainty avoidance between the R&D team and the region where the team operates. This paper elaborates on the characteristics of ambidextrous KM initiatives at the micro-level; firms use ambidextrous KM practices to create a learning context, defined by guidelines and methods rather than by a definite purpose. The clear separation of KM initiatives’ purpose and their embedded learning routines and methods enables them to be used ambidextrously. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that ambidextrous KM initiatives follow a path characterized by an increasing variety of purposes but a decreasing variety of underlying structures. Consequently, firms create a learning context that can be activated when necessary in ways required in an exploratory and/or in an exploitative mode. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Conducted across various European countries from May to July 2023, this study, with a final dataset of 145 responses, ventures beyond traditional technology acceptance models. By integrating Hofstede's cultural dimensions with the perceived usefulness construct from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we explore their collective impact on cloud service utilization in the workplace. Employing a robust survey methodology and ordinal logistic regression analysis, this research reveals nuanced insights into how individualism and uncertainty avoidance influence cloud adoption, with perceived usefulness acting as a pivotal moderator. The findings not only extend the theoretical discourse on technology acceptance by highlighting the intricate role of cultural factors but also offer practical guidance for crafting IT strategies that align with individual cultural values. Contributing to the scholarly conversation on digital transformation within organizational contexts, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving cloud service utilization among employees.

	abstract = {Culture influences the way people can be managed successfully according to the organizational objectives including sustainability. Hofstede´s cultural dimensions have been widely studied in different contexts. Dorfman and Howell designed an instrument in English to measure those dimensions. However, there is no validated Spanish version for this instrument. The objective of this article is to provide to the Ibero-American community a Spanish version of the Dorfman and Howell instrument. The questionnaire was translated into Spanish and adapted to the Chilean and Colombian populations. The study included 1136 participants, 500 from Chile and 636 from Colombia. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were supported by the KMO and the Bartlett tests. Results indicate a better fit of a five-factor model, in similarity with the English language original instrument, as follows: masculinity–femininity, paternalism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism–collectivism. Construct validity of the scales was confirmed in the Chilean sample, showing results consistent with previous meta-analytical research. The Dorfman and Howell instrument is a valid questionnaire for the evaluation of cultural dimensions in Spanish-speaking populations. The measurement of culture is a tool that leaders have available to facilitate the understanding and management of people. Organizations with operations in different countries or with intercultural context may use the results of this instrument to tune up their interventions. © 2022 by the authors.

While knowledge and best practices become moving targets, the modern-organizations have swiftly moved to psychological safety culture that fosters growth, innovation and individual learning. In context, transformational leadership fosters innovative behaviors and learning abilities, successful organizational transformations and effective actions for performance beyond expectations. Hence, the study aims is to examine the impact of transformational leadership on individual learning behavior, under mediating conditions of psychological safety and moderating influence of uncertainty avoidance. Using partial least squares (PLS) based structural equation modeling (SEM) and survey of 350 telecom-employees, the results reveal that transformational leadership and individual learning behavior relationship is partially mediated by psychological safety. Alternatively, uncertainty avoidance reveals an insignificant role as a moderator. Our findings generate managerial implications for advancing individual learning cultures and guiding continuous improvements in diverse work settings. In line with the theoretical base of "too much of a good thing (TMGT) effect", our study highlights potential avenues for future research to explore the dark side of psychological safety and its counter-productive effect on workplace behaviors. © 2020 Johar Education Society Pakistan.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to investigate the national open data portals of Japan, The Netherlands and Saudi Arabia to identify the role of cultural variations in terms of their open data initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative approach, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions are probed to appreciate the extent to which the cultures of Japan, The Netherlands and Saudi Arabia are different. Thereafter, the national open data portals of the three countries are analyzed in terms of their nature and scope to underline the extent to which there is a match between the cultural characteristics and the extent of commitment and implementation of open data initiative. Findings: There are cultural dissimilarities across the three countries and the same is reflected in the extent of commitment toward open data initiatives. Saudi Arabia, with its “collectivist” and high “power distance” score, is more reserved in implementing its open data initiative as compared with Japan or The Netherlands. Similarly, The Netherlands, which scores high in terms of “feminity” and “long-term orientation,” is more forthcoming in publishing data sets, with many government organizations taking up the initiative of publishing the data sets. Finally, with more degree of “uncertainty avoidance,” Saudi Arabia prefers to remain on the safe side by publishing only those data sets that are non-controversial, insensitive and readily available. At the same time, the open data initiatives across the three countries require the adoption of a more rigorous and committed approach to ensure that the goals of transparency and public accountability are better met and there is more reuse of the data sets by improvising the user-friendliness of the interfaces for tapping them. Research limitations/implications: Taking examples from three countries, representative of the different cultural characteristics, it is desirable that further research be conducted by including more countries and deriving an evaluation framework for analyzing the sustainability of the open data initiatives in terms of their culture. Practical implications: Governments are encouraged to adopt a more committed stance toward institutionalizing the open data initiatives and policymakers should ensure that the quality of data sets is sustained for maximum reuse of the data sets and for the derivation of public value. Social implications: Citizens should engage themselves in tapping the data sets for improvising them and contribute toward the existing data sets as well. Originality/value: Hitherto, there has been focus on the examples of open data initiatives across different countries, but the role of culture was never investigated while analyzing the open data initiatives. This is the first study where the countries’ open data initiatives are probed in terms of the cultural variations across the three countries using the cultural dimensions identified by Hofstede. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, evidence from research regarding the efficiency of such a deterrence approach has been mixed. Drawing on this inconsistency, this paper examines the applicability of deterrence theory in information security policy compliance research. It is argued that contextual and methodological moderators play a crucial role when conceptualizing deterrence theory in security studies. Applying a meta-analysis, the results suggest that sanctions have an overall effect on deviant behavior. However, the results also indicate that this relationship is dependent on the study’s context. Deterrence theory better predicts deviant behavior in malicious contexts, cultures with a high degree of power distance, and cultures with a high uncertainty avoidance. The meta-analysis also reveals no meaningful differences arising from the methodological context in terms of scenario-based and behavior-specific measurement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Prior organizational research has shown that destructive leadership adversely affects followers’ job satisfaction. However, we still have an incomplete understanding of why the strength of this relationship varies across contexts. In this study, we leverage implicit leadership theory to explain why cross-national differences in cultural values moderate this relationship. First, drawing on implicit leadership theory, we develop theory-based predictions about why the cultural value dimensions from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) study explain differences in the strength of this relationship across countries. Then, we aggregate findings from 51 primary studies (k = 51, N = 16,870) conducted across 12 countries to test our hypotheses. Our results indicate that the negative relationship between destructive leadership and job satisfaction weakens in magnitude as uncertainty avoidance, future orientation, power distance, and assertiveness values increase. Conversely, the negative relationship between destructive leadership and job satisfaction strengthens in magnitude as institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, humane orientation, performance orientation, and gender egalitarianism values increase. We also demonstrate the independent, relative, and collective predictive validity of GLOBE’s cultural values as moderators of the relationship between destructive leadership and followers’ job satisfaction. Collectively, our findings (1) indicate that cross-national differences exist in the relationship between destructive leadership and followers’ job satisfaction and (2) highlight the need to consider destructive leadership in light of the broader cultural context in which it is being examined. © The Author(s) 2024.},

We aim to examine the interconnection between these elements and conduct an in-depth theoretical research paper focusing on these elements and the different variables related to them. The study deeply examines the theoretical literature associated with various definitions of culture and its correlation with leadership, and comes up finally with results and recommendations. The researchers are also examining whether the nature of the relationship can be determined by market conditions, like the level of competition and the organisational age and scale. Market competition appears to affect the direction of the relationship, with the corresponding impact of operational age and size. Such findings show that both organisational factors contribute significantly, while the alignment of factors (identical cultural type and leadership style) improves this connection. Such observations refer to the work of Hofstede (1980), the most commonly quoted work on the subject (Bond, 2002). Hofstede used the five-dimension method (power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, avoidance of confusion, long-term orientation) for the development of national-cultural profiles. Since no significant market changes took place over the last five years (in terms of reform or privatisation), leadership and culture are most likely associated with a transparent system. Some studies argue that leaders are cultural, but they also transform culture by imposing new values, trends and standards of behaviour. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

Building on this finding, the present study examines how the amount of institutional and value support for cultural pluralism in a society is related to its climate and level of innovation performance. Cultural pluralism is defined as the societal condition in which minority groups within a society can maintain their distinctive cultural identities, values, and practices provided that they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. Institutions and values that support cultural pluralism include political democracy, tolerance for uncertainty, prioritization of secular-rational values, and openness to foreign cultures. I hypothesize that institutional and value support for cultural pluralism is stronger in societies with more challenging climate and higher innovation performance. I tested this hypothesis using society-level measures of harshness of climatic condition and innovation performance as predictors. The results showed that in societies with demanding climate and high innovation performance, their citizens tend to support democracy, are more tolerant of uncertainty, prioritize secular-rational values, and take more leisure trips outside of their home country. These results illustrate that innovation, through its moderation effect on climate, predicts the amount of institutional and value support for cultural pluralism, highlighting the reciprocal effects of culture and innovation. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.},

Therefore, the concepts of person-organization fit and person-job fit can also be affected by the managers' culture. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to examine the relationships between organization, job fit and cultural values of nurse managers working in university hospitals in Turkey. METHODS: This research is a cross-sectional analytical study. The research sample comprised 391 nurse managers working in the 20 university hospitals in Turkey. The research data were collected via an information form, individual cultural values scale, person-organization fit scale (POFS), and person-job fit scale (PJFS). Descriptive statistics were computed to define demographic characteristics. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between numeric variables. RESULTS: The means of the nurse managers' power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, masculinity, long-term orientation scores were 3.03, 5.98, 5.34, 3.02, and 5.60, respectively. The means of the nurse managers' POFS and PJFS scores were 3.33 and 4.13, respectively. There was a positive relationship among power distance and long-term orientation dimensions and person-organization fit, while there was a negative relationship between the masculinity dimension and person-job fit (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the nurse managers' individual cultural values were related to the organization and job fit. In this context, it is worth considering the individuals' cultural values in nurse recruitment and selection processes.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

This study assumes even more significance when taking into account the countries nationalistic culture, which has a high power distance index and high uncertainty avoidance index as per the Hofstede Cultural Dimensions Index. Change management initiative is expensive in nature more so, in a pluralistic environment with multiple cultures as the case of the organization under study. The challenge becomes even more difficult if the change is targeted at the existing cultures in the organization. As the authors were part of the change management initiative, the various stages adopted in moving the organization culture from entitlement to performance are analyzed in detail. The use of common narratives and unified performance appraisal methodology, leadership engagement and Normalization process lead to a demonstrated change in the performance appraisal rating for the targeted group of employees. The impact of the common narratives, lead to a decrease in the rating of exceeding and above categories for managers and above by almost 50 %.What it effectively highlights is that the journey to build a performance driven culture is ongoing and it's through the common narratives and understanding that the desired outcomes can be achieved. Such a large scale study on the impact of building a new performance culture has not been done in the Middle East before. The learnings would be of immense value to organizations wanting to incorporate such changes in the future. In addition, limited papers have adopted the action research method to observe culture creation phenomena in spite of it offering clear insights due to the involvement of the authors in the culture creation. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Underpinned by the ability–motivation–opportunity framework, this paper aims to establish a framework of employee creativity antecedents in the hospitality and tourism industries and meta-analytically examine the magnitude of effect sizes as well as the moderating effects of cultural factors. Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analysis using data from 82 independent studies was conducted to explore the hypothesized relationships and verify how they were contingent on uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation. Findings: The results supported the majority of hypotheses about the relationships between antecedents and creativity. Furthermore, they showed that the effects of intrinsic motivation, positive affect and climate for innovation on creativity in the hospitality and tourism industries were significantly larger than those reported in previous meta-analyses. It also showed that uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation could buffer or strengthen some associations. Practical implications: This study generates some essential managerial suggestions for organizations in need of innovation. Managers can learn from the results so as to effectively promote the ability, motivation and opportunity for creativity and merge cultural elements with innovation strategy when they operate globally. Originality/value: This study provides a theory-based explanation for how employee creativity can be activated. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is a first attempt to meta-analytically test the underlying determinants of employee creativity in the hospitality and tourism industries. Additionally, the search for boundary conditions of the proposed relationships is likely to reconcile existing conflicts and inspire future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Although KS is informed by culture, the external validity of the empirical results of most of the research investigating the influence of culture, defined and operationalised at the macro (national or organisational) level, on KS is problematic since the cultural orientation of individuals in a particular society or organisation may not be homogeneous. This study adopted a Theory of Reasoned Action-based model to analyze the influence of espoused individualism-collectivism (IC), espoused uncertainty avoidance (UCA), social norm (SN), and attitude (ATT) on academics' KS intentions and behaviours. The results are derived using a data set from a large public Arabian University. SN, ATT, and intention positively influence KS behaviour. Collectivism positively influences SN, ATT, intention, and behaviour. Unexpectedly, uncertainty tolerance positively influences ATT and intention. These results provide significant statistical support for the explanatory power of the model. They also put forward empirically based evidence that adds much-needed nuance to the current discourse on KS intention and behaviour and informs policies and strategies that enhance KS in the academe. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

While research has found significant cross-country differences in organizations’ spending on professional services, we do not know why they occur. Inspired by the organizational buying behavior literature, this paper investigates the influence of national culture on the use of professional services, particularly management consulting services. As the use of professional services involves considerable uncertainties—particularly for the buyer—it can be assumed to be influenced by cultural differences regarding the level of Uncertainty Avoidance, Individualism and Masculinity. By drawing on two independent cross-country studies, we show that organizations in high uncertainty avoidance and individualistic cultures use professional services less than organizations in low uncertainty avoidance and collectivist cultures. We found no relationship between Hofstede's dimension of Masculinity and the use of professional services. The findings contribute to the theorizing on how the cultural context influences organizational buying behavior and the purchasing of professional services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The analysis uses the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey data over the 2004–2012 period and relies on extensive robustness checks based on four internationally recognized cross-cultural research projects: the GLOBE study of House et al.

(Cultures and organizations: software of the mind, 3rd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York, 2010), the International Social Survey Program, and the World Values Survey. There is strong evidence that patriotism deters foreign investment and increases overinvestment in domestic bonds.

	abstract = {Many consumer goods multinational companies (MNCs) operate host-market subsidiaries that are responsible for managing relationships with local retailers. These retailers often follow a decentralized approach by formally involving their store managers in key decision-making processes related to the MNCs’ brands. While store managers play a key role in the success of MNCs’ brands, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) what drives a store manager’s psychological engagement with MNCs’ brands across cultures, and (2) do cultural differences matter to translating store managers’ psychological brand engagement into constructive brand voice behavior? We answer these questions using a multilevel dataset spanning nine Latin American countries/MNC subsidiaries, five data sources, and three time periods. The findings reveal that uncertainty avoidance exerts a differing moderating influence on the relationship of MNC–retailer relationship investment and the store managers' MNC brand knowledge with psychological brand engagement, whereas individualism and uncertainty avoidance positively moderate the effect of MNC’s extra-contractual incentives on store managers' psychological brand engagement. Also, psychological brand engagement takes on a more important role in leading store managers to speak up, at lower levels of long-term orientation. Finally, we show that inducing store managers to engage in constructive brand voice behavior increases time-lagged, objective data on MNC’s salesperson performance. © 2022, Academy of International Business.},

In the following days, media reports showed that consumers increasingly stockpiled groceries and household supplies. Interestingly, behavioral data show that this stockpiling exhibited considerable heterogeneity across countries. Building on cultural dimension theory, the authors theorize that this heterogeneity can be explained by countries’ cultural values: consumer stockpiling after the World Health Organization's announcement was more pronounced in countries whose residents show high uncertainty avoidance, low long-term orientation, low indulgence, and high individualism. The authors confirm these propositions using global mobility data from Google matched with country-level data on cultural values, pandemic reaction policies, and other key variables. This research note thereby integrates the previously disconnected literature on cultural dimension theory and consumer stockpiling in general, as well as provides new and significant knowledge about cross-cultural consumer behavior in crises. Furthermore, the authors provide actionable insights for international policy makers and business managers who aim to predict or control consumer stockpiling in future global crises to enhance consumer well-being. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Introduction.The issue of homo economicus modeling is quite topical nowadays. Post-nonclassical science pays special attention to the subject of research and is focused on the way an individual affects all social processes, including the economic ones. Engineering design of the economy system based on the evolutionary algorithms is a matter of special research of many modern economists, being aimed at exposing most common patterns in the functioning of national cultures and national economics. Methodology. The main tool in interpreting the homo economicus model is a dynamic modeling of the ethnometric parameters, put forward by a Dutch sociologist G. Hofstede. Besides, some evidence pointing to the necessity to go on with homo economics modeling based on cultural “software of the mind”is provided and it is regarded as an additional proof of the thesis used in the humanities about the culture’s influence on economics. We developed the parial swap organization method for designing a model for economy system. Discussion. The homo economicus model is one of the most widely accepted in scientific community and at the same time, the most arguable one. The scientific community agrees that the homo economicus model plays a most significant role in nations’ well-being. Moreover, the thesis of culture’s impact on economy is most notable as it shifts the research focus towards culture study and sociology in investigating the homo economics models. Ethnometricindices suggested by G. Hofstede allow for correlation analysis being used in measuring such cultural issues as high level of individualism, high masculinity level, long-term life-orientation in the context of low power distance and low uncertainty avoidance as the crucial ones in promoting high national economicgrowth.Results. It is worth noting that notwithstanding the assurance of a great number of sociologists and economists that the above mentioned characteristics guarantee the well-being of the nation, none of the developed European countries proves the conclusion by the course of their development. In entails that the most appropriate in the situation will be the refusal of the universal homo economicus model and the shift towards the cultural peculiarities of individual nations in order to investigate their specific potential for economic development. Conclusion. It revealed that the using optimization algorithms in designing a dynamic model for economy canbe efficient. It goes without saying that the approaches, developed by G. Hofstede have a high heuristic potential for analyzing correlations of interconnection between culture and economics. However, it is obvious that a universal homo economicus model exists only in theory while its practical application results in deviations from an ideal model under the impact of specific traits of national cultures. And the latter has a substantial influence on the way of economic advancement. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of culture on organizational readiness to change (ORC) within the context of merger and acquisition (M&A) in the banking sector in India. Design/methodology/approach: A multisource approach is used to collect data from a public-sector bank in India for testing our hypothesis. A hierarchical approach based on higher-order modelling has been deployed for confirming the path model. The foundation of the study is based on power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) cultural dimensions of Hofstede (1984). Findings: Employees in organizations with large PD and high UA index exhibit low readiness to change. Findings support a negative relationship of culture (large PD and high UA) with organizational readiness to change at the individual level. Research limitations/implications: The study has three major implications. First, measures and importance of change readiness at the individual level during corporate events such as M&A is elucidated in the study. Second, a paradigm for assessing higher-order models grounded in theoretical and methodological rigour for testing our hypothesis is presented in the paper. Last, the role of culture in M&A processes is highlighted vis-à-vis factors related to PD and UA on ORC. Practical implications: The findings of the research answer to the call for a study on factors that help in creating a synergy for successful M&A across all sectors especially in the banking sector. People representing high UA and large PD often look forward to direction and guidelines for guiding employee actions. Leaders therefore need to set clear agenda and effectively communicate the appropriateness of change to their employees for developing positive behaviour towards desirable organizational outcomes. This study touches upon this important perspective for its practical utilization. Originality/value: The study adds to the limited literature on change which addresses the need for studying socio-cultural factors in the M&A process, especially in an emerging economies context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A three-step research process has been used, including literature review, qualitative interviews, and then a quantitative survey. The literature review and the qualitative interviews with university instructors guide the development of a causal model that suggests antecedents and outcomes for organisation justice in an educational setting. The nature, direction and magnitude of the proposed relationship between organisational justice and variables identified from the literature review and the qualitative phase are tested. Correlation, regression and analysis of variance are used to test the hypothesised model. The result provides insights on the nature of the relationship among these variables for finding effective means towards nurturing a positive educational environment where instructors are motivated to utilise their full potential in achieving educational goals. Findings show that instructors' demographic characteristics and cultural values explain the variance in perceived organisational justice and strong empirical evidence exists for the positive effect of perceived organisation justice on instructors' motivation. Perceived organisation justice mediates the relationship between instructors' cultural values and motivation. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The Hofstede's cultural data are constructed from survey data collected between 1967 and 1973. The data on corruption in bank lending taken from the world business environment survey (WBES), however, were collected between 1999 and 2000. This paper uses cultural data from the global leadership and organisational behaviour effectiveness (GLOBE) project which are constructed from survey data collected in the 1990s instead. The data from the GLOBE project are not only more recent but also provide more cultural dimensions than those of Hofstede. The results indicate that in-group collectivism still increases corruption in bank lending. The results suggest that assertiveness and uncertainty avoidance no longer have a significant effect on corruption in bank lending. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A significant amount of research has shown that drivers of employee attitudes, and behaviors leading to outcome variables such as turnover intentions, are strongly influenced by national culture. This study focuses on the difference in relationships among some critical variables between two emerging economies with similar cultural indices. Design/methodology/approach: Survey questionnaire was used to collect responses from salespeople in two countries. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to provide support for the stated hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that Mexican and Indian salespeople differ in how their level of trust in supervisor, regulation of emotion, interpersonal conflict and felt stress related to drive turnover intention. Findings also confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on survey responses and should be interpreted with the associated limitations of method bias. The hypothesized model of relationships among constructs was based on theory and prior research, but researchers understand that there could be other statistically equivalent models with equal fit. Moreover, stress can result from numerous other combinations of variables in addition to those used in this model. The relationships among constructs as presented could also be due to the absence of other key variables. This study looked at turnover intentions from an employee perspective using responses made when economic conditions worldwide were robust. This is not the case today because of the global pandemic. Economic conditions wield substantial influence on employee responses as well as on turnover intentions. In addition, economic downturn lowers turnover potential and heightens stress level. Practical implications: Findings confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. Efforts to keep stress within a productive range should be encouraged, because while the direct costs of turnover can be substantial, indirect costs may be even greater. For example, when salespeople leave an organization, the customer relationships they formed and developed may be at risk, exposing their companies to potential reduction in revenue. Sales organizations that pay inadequate attention to high turnover rate among their salespeople become susceptible to a phenomenon Dudley and Goodson (1988) identified as “low sales recruiting ceiling syndrome.” Social implications: Most of the current studies results from developing countries have been compared to those from developed countries where the theories and seminal research originated. The outcome of the authors' research lends yet another argument in favor of more comparative studies on East versus East or developing economies versus developing economies. Such effort could further delineate the applicability of “foreign” theories and inform the development of “local” theories for richer insight on local management practice. The current drive to inject diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace should be reflected in the development of theory and the conduct of research. No one country or individual or group of individuals can claim ownership of theory development and standards for assessing theories originating elsewhere. Diversity, equity and inclusion have a place in academic research and should be encouraged. Second, the results obtained in this paper offer a cautionary note against over-generalization. Just as small details matter in life, likewise, small differences in variables that explain a phenomenon can make a big difference. Third, the findings confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. This is true for the two countries examined in this research. Originality/value: This study seeks to understand why potential drivers of turnover intention might manifest differently in countries that have a similar cultural outlook. The current research leverages the contingency theory and zeroed in on turnover intention. In addition, two additional cultural dimensions (long-term orientation and uncertainty avoidance) were incorporated, and the model was tested using salespeople (rather than plant workers). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The current study attempts to do so by introducing organizational role ambiguity (ORA), operationalized as an organization's structured communication strategy about performance expectations between work role, division, and organization, as a correlate of UA. Data on ORA, risk-taking, and organizational satisfaction were collected from over 15,000 respondents in 20 countries and data on cultural values, wealth, sources of guidance, personality, and satisfaction were extracted from published data. Results show that ORA negatively correlates with UA and intellectual autonomy values, as well as organizational satisfaction, but positively correlates with risk-taking, masculinity values, lateral (coworkers as) sources of guidance, agreeableness, and job satisfaction. Thus, ORA, a construct organizations often assess in engagement and climate surveys, appears to be a reasonable correlate of UA. The country's cultural context of UA is reflected in the collective experience of an organization's communication structures within a given country. These findings have implications for organization's accessing their own, already available, ORA data to understand its implications on employee experiences, as well as for intercultural training and global research on occupational stress. © 2021},

However, implementing and sustaining lean processes are easier in some organisations than in others. There may be societal culture differences, as the successes in initial implementation in Japan have not been followed by global success. As organisations accelerate their lean efforts to gain or maintain competitive advantage, studying societal cultural effects seems timely. Understanding of the societal culture that the firm or subsidiary is operating in would be useful in determining how lean processes should lead the effort. Using the cultural dimensions developed by Hofstede, we examine the interconnection of societal culture and lean processes. For example, a societal emphasis on individualism is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of individual employee involvement, individual creativity and firm efficiency. A societal emphasis on high uncertainty avoidance is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of control and standardisation, efficiency and long-term philosophy. A societal emphasis on high power distance is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of control and standardisation, and efficiency. A long-term orientation in the society will be positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of all of the dimensions. A societal emphasis on femininity will be positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of employee involvement, creativity and long-term philosophy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The strategies and policies regarding obesity were developed; however, the effect of culture is not adequately considered. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between obesity rates of countries, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, Schwartz’s values, and Gross National Income per capita per country. The data consist of obesity ranking (i.e., the percentage of the population with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or higher), Gross National Income per capita for each country, and cultural variables (i.e., Hofstede’s cultural dimensions for 54 nations and Schwartz’s cultural values for 57 nations). Hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that Gross National Income per capita was not a significantly related obesity at the aggregated level. Among Hofstede’s dimensions, individualism and uncertainty avoidance were positively associated with obesity, and long-term orientation was negatively associated with obesity. The relationship between Schwartz’s cultural values and obesity was not found to be significant. Findings suggest that Hofstede’s cultural dimensions should be considered when developing national level strategies and campaigns to decrease obesity. © The Author(s) 2018.},

This study bridges this gap through a four-level conceptual model of the role of uncertainty avoidance in the formation of employees’ intrapreneurial intentions, differentiating among unit- and country-level uncertainty avoidance. Using the established relationship between behavioral control and intentions, we consider how employee creativity and self-efficacy influence intrapreneurial intentions. Following the person-environment fit paradigm and the resulting fit traditions of complementarity and supplementarity, we narrow in on how these processes operate within specific (stimulating or inhibiting) cultural settings in terms of uncertainty avoidance at both the unit and country levels. Using data from 787 employees on the first level nested into 73 units on the second level, 19 organizations on the third level, and eight countries on the fourth level, study shows evidence for a beneficial interplay between unit-level uncertainty avoidance and creativity or self-efficacy when there is a supplementary or complementarity fit. The interplay between behavioral and contextual factors is negative, however, when neither type of fit applies. Finally, country-level uncertainty avoidance seems to be irrelevant to intrapreneurial intentions. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Theory suggests that national culture influences bank risk-taking behavior directly by conditioning the decision-making of human participants. This study uses an international sample of banks from 75 countries and examines the direct effects of national culture on bank risk-taking behavior. We measure national culture with four dimensions - uncertainty avoidance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity and power distance - from Hofstede's framework of national culture. We find strong evidence that bank risk-taking is significantly higher in countries which have high individualism, low uncertainty avoidance, and low power distance cultural values. We confirm main results using alternate cultural dimensions from House et al. (2004. Culture, Leadership, and Organizations. Sage)'s framework of national culture, using alternative bank risk-taking proxies, and using instrumental variables analysis for endogeneity issues. This paper adds to our understanding by finding that cultural values lead to bank risk-taking decisions that may deviate in systematic and geographically predictable ways. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Traditional studies used quantitative data, such as ratings, to measure eWOM. However, recent studies analyzed unstructured data, such as comments, through web-based text analysis. Based on recent research trends, we analyzed not only quantitative data, like ratings, but also text data, like reviews, and we performed a sentiment analysis using a text mining technique. Studies have also examined the effect of cultural differences on the decision-making processes of individuals and organizations. We applied Hofstede's cultural theory to eWOM and analyzed the moderating effect of cultural differences on eWOM influence. We selected 338 films released between 2006 and 2015 from the Box Office Mojo database. We collected ratings and reviews, box office revenues, and other basic information from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). We also analyzed the effects of cultural differences, such as power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, on box office performance. We found that user comments have a greater impact on film sales than user ratings, and movie stars and co-production contribute to box office success. We also conclude that cultural and geographical differences moderate the sentiment elasticity of eWOM. © 2019 by the authors.},

Based on an interpretive approach, the authors have articulated a situated cultural approach based on structuration theory to identify the cultural dimensions that have provided an understanding of the cultural influence on customers' channel choice. The results highlighted that verbal, human interaction, traditional shopping, and cash based were the themes for customers' channel choice through the four stages of customer life cycle. The results also show that the customers' channel choices were linked to the following Egyptian cultural dimensions: Collectivism, market price relationship, emotional, power distance, low trust, uncertainty avoidance, and universalism. © 2021 IGI Global.

It further examines the moderating effects of organisational size and uncertainty avoidance (UA) on the positive relationship between senior foreign manager and strategic change in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data econometrics and multilevel analyses were adopted to run the model. The author tests hypotheses on 263 emerging market firms (EMFs), originating from nine EMs. Findings: Empirical results reveal that senior foreign managers are active agents who can promote and implement strategic change in an organisation. They possess a different set of values, knowledge and experiences that can trigger strategic change. In addition, firm size and UA weaken the relationship between senior foreign manager ratio and strategic change of a firm. Practical implications: This study indicates that recruiting committees of EMFs should consider hiring senior foreign managers to foster a higher degree of strategic change. Nevertheless, firm size and UA may impose implementation difficulties for senior, foreign managers. As a result, the focal firm should be flexible and open to change. Originality/value: This study aims to contribute to strategic change and top management team internationalisation literature by promoting the role of senior foreign managers and national culture on strategic change. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies have investigated organisational-level and sectorial-level determinants of corporate sustainability practice (hereinafter referred to as CSP) such as Board attributes, audit committee meetings, shareholders’ activism, ownership structure and sustainability-linked compensation, and industry type. However, most studies have been conducted at the country level, as there have been calls to conduct an investigation using intercountry evidence; therefore, studies that focus on country-level governance factors affecting CSP are scarce. Against this backdrop, the current study investigates country-level governance factors (i.e., Voice and Accountability; Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism; Government Effectiveness; Regulatory Quality; Rule of Law; and Control of Corruption) and national culture dimensions proposed by Hofstede (i.e., Power distance; Individualism; Masculinity; Uncertainty avoidance; Long-term orientation; and Indulgence) affecting CSP in an international context of 204 oil and gas firms cutting across 36 countries over a 10-year period (2011–2020). Result from the analysis using multivariate regression, generalised linear models regression and discriminant analysis reveals that the country-level governance factor strongly promoting CSP is the rule of law, whilst four of the national culture factor positively influence on CSP except power distance and masculinity. This current study contributes to knowledge by presenting empirical evidence that country-level and national culture factors affect CSP. The study, thus, argues for the inclusion of country governance factors and cultural dimension that may affect CSP in addition to other well-known factors affecting sustainability practice. The study also adds to literature by providing empirical support for the Hofstede Model on national cultural dimensions affecting accounting and organisational practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

Our results show that Chilean TikTokers are the least engaged on the platform, but have more followers on average than their American and Spanish counterparts. Additionally, users’ motivations for and uses of TikTok are associated with their countries’ national cultural values. For instance, TikTok users in Chile and Spain, which are collectivistic societies, view the platform as a socialisation tool more than users in the individualistic United States. Lastly, Chileans, who have a high uncertainty avoidance level, tend to avoid self-expression and archiving on TikTok compared to Americans, who have a low uncertainty avoidance level. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Culture shapes behaviors of people and distinguishes members of one group or category from another. The decision-making process depends greatly on cultural background. Executives’ financial decisions show variance from society to society as a result of their cultural differences. The objective of this study is to point out the effects of national culture on financial decision-making. We examined Hofstede’s cultural dimensions among 20 countries around the world to explain the variation of financial decisions based on cultural differences. According to our results, power-distance has an effect on all financial decisions included in the study, except for the capital structure. Individualism also has an influence on all the financial decisions we analyzed, except for Research & Development (R&D) expenditures. Uncertainty avoidance is found to have an effect on all of the financial decision parameters included here, except for discretionary accruals, which are an indication of a firm’s earnings-management decisions and can be considered as a clue for manipulation of earnings. Masculinity is found to have an effect only on capital structure and working capital level. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

A firm's CSR is influenced by the cultural context of a given society and, according to the upper echelons theory, the characteristics of its corporate executives. However, there was no empirical evidence on the moderating role of CEO narcissism, a common CEO characteristic in many cases, on the national culture-CSR relationship. This study finds that a firm with more properties in high-UA societies has less involvement in CSR and that CEO narcissism positively moderates the relationship. The results provide a meaningful empirical addition to the upper echelons literature by demonstrating how CEO traits can serve as a boundary condition in examining the impact of uncertainty avoidance, as a contextual factor, on CSR, as an organizational outcome, in the restaurant industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Drawing on the expectancy theory, this study aims to discuss the significant causal relationship between the implementation of single-rating, multi-rating 360° performance management (PM) and organizational outcomes such as trust, commitment, satisfaction and intention to leave. Design/methodology/approach: Using the self-reported measures and survey method, data were collected from 439 employees from different organizations across the UAE. Explanatory factor analysis, simple linear regression and multi-group were used to test the proposed conceptual model and examine the mediation and moderation impact. Findings: The study explored the best-practices attributes of the traditional single-rating, multi-rating 360° PM within a non-western context. This study also provides empirical evidence on the significant role of uncertainty avoidance and power distance orientation as a mediator between the relationship between these PMSs and trust, commitment, job satisfaction and intention to leave. Finally, this paper examined the effect of many demographic variables (such as gender, age, industry type […]) on the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Originality/value: This study extends research on PM theories and models. Another important aspect of this study is that its model has been tested on the UAE’s data, an underrepresented geographic region in the management literature. Given all the PM’s positive characteristics, the way that this feedback is viewed and interpreted by employees may be moderated according to the employee’s management level, age, gender and many other demographics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Through the simple random sampling technique, the hypotheses were tested with a sample of 604 employees from a mobile telecommunication company operating in both China and Ghana, two countries that represent two same and opposite cultural poles on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Findings: The results point that employee motives such as relationship, supervision, challenging work and achievement are moderated by cultural values. Whilst employees with high power distance cultural values are highly motivated by high supervision, those with low individualistic cultural values are highly motivated by high relationship. The results also depict that whilst the interaction effects between supervision and power distance and relationship and individualism on performance were marginal for both China and Ghana samples, the interaction effect of achievement and masculinity as well as challenging work and uncertainty avoidance on performance had great differences due to the different cultural values for the two countries. Practical implications: This study implies that, as organizations are devising strategies to lower personnel costs in a recessionary period, there is the need to redesign motivation factors that go beyond monetary means and based on the cultural background of an employee in order to improve performance.

	abstract = {The present study was designed to explore the validity and applicability of the uncertainty-avoidance dimension in the contemporary world. Because social, cultural, and commercial interrelationships among countries have significantly increased since the introduction of this dimension, it would be advisable to revisit and investigate the substantiality of this dimension before making beneficial suggestions to people who engage in cultural encounters. A questionnaire was constructed, tested, edited, and distributed to 2,000 organizational members in Japan, France, Great Britain, and Singapore. Among the 1,258 questionnaires returned, 1,215 were included in the analysis. Not surprisingly, cultural differences among countries still exist. The findings of the present study suggest that cultural characteristics have become more complicated since the uncertainty-avoidance dimension was introduced four decades ago. To yield more detailed guidelines on cultural variabilities, future studies should examine factors such as education, generation gaps, occupations, religions, and degrees of intercultural contacts, along with how these factors influence variability among cultures. © 2021, Immigrant Institutet.

Five cultural dimensions were used in the study; power distance, masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long term/short term orientation, and the research found out that individualism and long term orientation were significantly correlated with cybersecurity development. These findings have strategic implications in helping government and decision makers fashion out relevant policies and programmes while taking into cognisance the cultural factors in the improvement of the cyberwellness profile and the development of strategic cybersecurity.

	abstract = {A solid understanding of when travel decisions are made in relation to travelers’ planning horizons is crucial for travel service providers. Despite its importance, there are very few empirical studies investigating the planning horizon and its antecedents in travel research literature. This study contributes to bridging this gap by conceptualizing a two-level model of antecedents of travelers’ planning horizons. In addition to individual traveler- and trip-related aspects, the model provides a cross-cultural perspective on international travelers’ planning horizons by including uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and long-term orientation as cultural-level antecedents. Drawing on a nested dataset of 4,074 international travelers from 17 countries worldwide, the results of a two-level hierarchical regression model show that, in addition to individual-level aspects, cultural antecedents play an important role in determining planning horizons. Based on the empirical results, the paper discusses implications for theory and travel service providers. © The Author(s) 2022.},

The four experiments were conducted locally with graduate students at business schools in Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The results show that there are differences in the approach to cooperation among teams from each country as we hypothesised and that country-specific variables are the source of differences in behaviour.

Whereas some authors emphasised that company characteristics, like the product demand profile, are significant factors in lean projects, other studies analysed the impact of national culture. This paper aims to study the combined effect of various factors related to national culture and company characteristics of lean implementation barriers in order to determine whether the environmental context in which the company operation can affect the outcome of lean project implementation. A survey has been conducted to collect information about companies of various sizes (small–medium–large) in all industry fields. Data from companies, including manufacturing firms, in 23 different countries, were analysed in depth by a combination of Association Rules and Network Analysis. The results show that some national culture dimensions, such as Performance Orientation and Gender Egalitarianism, influence lean management success and help to maintain a lean culture. Maintaining a lean culture is even more critical than developing it. Furthermore, if the implementation of lean practices is an arduous task for large organisations, it becomes even greater for SMEs. Other cultural factors of individuals such as Uncertainty Avoidance, Future Orientation and Institutional Collectivism also help to support a lean culture and overcome human and cultural barriers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Social power differences fundamentally shape the behavioral interaction dynamics of groups and societies. While it has long been recognized that individual socio-cultural preferences mitigate social interactions involving persons of power, there is limited empirical data on the underlying neural correlates. To bridge this gap, we asked university student participants to decide whether they were willing to engage in social activities involving their teachers (higher power status), classmates (equal power status), or themselves (control) while functional brain images were acquired. Questionnaires assessed participants' preferences for power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and cultural intelligence. As expected, participants generally accepted more social interactions with classmates than teachers. Also, left inferior frontal activity was higher when accepting than when rejecting social interactions with teachers. Critically, power distance preferences further modulated right lateral frontoparietal activity contrasting approach relative to avoidance decisions towards teachers. In addition, uncertainty avoidance modulated activity in medial frontal, precuneus, and left supramarginal areas distinguishing approach decisions towards teachers relative to classmates. Cultural intelligence modulated neural responses to classmate approach/avoidance decisions in anterior cingulate and left parietal areas. Overall, functional activities in distinct brain networks reflected different personal socio-cultural preferences despite observed social decisions to interact with others of differential power status. Such findings highlight that social approach or avoidance behaviors towards powerful persons involves differential subjective neural processes possibly involved in computing implicit social utility. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The effect of culture on various aspects of life, business and disciplines such as knowledge management (KM) has been much studied. Hospitality has also received much attention because it, among others, can produce and redistribute wealth whether in developed or developing economies, who often find it as an invaluable means of generating foreign income. Nonetheless, there is no combination of the three areas in a single study done in a developing economy. The paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of culture on the adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Hofstede’s culture model and technology acceptance model were used as underpinning theories to develop a research model which was operationalised into a 45-item questionnaire. A five-point Likert scale that ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree was used. The questions were closed-ended for the variables of the model, but there were also open-ended questions. Two Nigerian cities were purposely sampled and they generated 195 responses from the 400 questionnaires that were distributed. Correlation analysis was first done to establish relationships before regression analysis was performed after checking for multicollinearity. Findings and conclusions were drawn from significant hypotheses. Findings: The findings showed significant collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, femininity and short- and long-term orientations as factors that would affect adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Power distance and individualism as factors, on the other hand, were not significant. Research limitations/implications: The research has produced a model that can form the basis for future research. The study apparently is the first and therefore needs replication in other industries and other developing economies. A comparative study can be done too between developing countries or between a developing and a developed country. Many replicated studies could perhaps produce a generic model that would apply beyond Nigeria. Moreover, as this study is on a moving target both in terms of culture and the extent of KM adoption, subsequent studies could update the findings of this study. Practical implications: Hospitality managers have to develop and maintain a conducive culture if adoption of KM is to be achieved. Managers should be sensitive to and take good advantage of cultural differences displayed in the personality traits of employees. For example, uncertainty avoidance (preference for precision) could be an asset to make knowledge explicit in computer systems, making it easier to share such knowledge in the organisation. Collectivism and nurturing orientation would encourage knowledge sharing and collaborative work, which is often nowadays done virtually. Managers should encourage knowledge workers to seek and acquire both short- and long-term views of their work. Originality/value: There apparently is no systematic empirical study that combines KM, hospitality and culture in developing economies’ context. Thus, this study examines the effects of culture on KM adoption in the Nigerian hospitality industry. The findings have practical implications on how the Nigerian hospitality industry can benefit from the application of KM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {As regional economic integration and climate change are among the most important phenomena influencing economic and social sustainability in the modern world, a huge volume of research is directed towards these topics nowadays. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of financial globalization and human capital on environmental degradation in One Belt One Road (OBOR) countries in a cultural context that is largely under-explored in spite of being immensely crucial for fulfilling the United Nations’ agenda on climate change mitigation. Owing to the presence of vast cultural differences, we check if the national scores on “Power Distance Index” and “Uncertainty Avoidance” in these countries matter for the environment. To this end, we use the latest and annual data set comprising 31 OBOR countries from 1996 to 2018, and employ panel econometric techniques that effectively deal with the threat of endogeneity. Results show that human capital improves environment while financial globalization deteriorates it. Interestingly, high power distance and uncertainty avoidance can reverse the positive impact of human capital. Similarly, financial globalization is favorable for environment in countries with low power distance and uncertainty avoidance. The findings are robust to the use of alternative specifications. Theoretical underpinnings and implications are discussed arising from the interesting reversal of traditional impacts in different cultural scenarios. Specifically, we recommend a culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, and inclusivity, promoted through increased tolerance towards risk-taking and participative decision-making to reap the benefits of human capital and globalization in improving the environment. Our results have important implications for climate change mitigation endeavors in OBOR countries and understanding the cultural context in this regard. Additionally, our study opens a vast avenue for the related research work in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Masculinity (MAS); 5. Long-Term Orientation (LTO); and 6. Indulgence vs Restraint (IND)). Sample was based on the 500 largest European companies rated by the Financial Times 2015. Profitability was measured by the ratios Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Statistical tests were performed to test whether the means of the variables used to measure profitability are statistically equal. The results indicate that companies with higher profitability are from countries with lower Power Distance, lower Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Higher Indulgence. © 2016, Virtus Interpress.

The findings show that the online store web atmosphere influences consumers’ cognitive innovativeness to purchase new products in countries with diverse degrees of uncertainty avoidance such as Australia.

A three-step research process has been used, including literature review, qualitative interviews, and then a quantitative survey. The literature review and the qualitative interviews with university instructors guide the development of a causal model that suggests antecedents and outcomes for organisation justice in an educational setting. The nature, direction and magnitude of the proposed relationship between organisational justice and variables identified from the literature review and the qualitative phase are tested. Correlation, regression and analysis of variance are used to test the hypothesised model. The result provides insights on the nature of the relationship among these variables for finding effective means towards nurturing a positive educational environment where instructors are motivated to utilise their full potential in achieving educational goals. Findings show that instructors' demographic characteristics and cultural values explain the variance in perceived organisational justice and strong empirical evidence exists for the positive effect of perceived organisation justice on instructors' motivation. Perceived organisation justice mediates the relationship between instructors' cultural values and motivation.  Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The examination significantly handles the theoretical composing identified with various implications of culture and its association with organization and comes up finally with the results and ideas.

Market competition seems to impact the course of the relationship, while operational age and size impact the relevant degree. The disclosures reveal a strong association between these two operational factors, while elements’ coordination (indistinguishable social sort and leadership style) carries out this relationship. These results are according to Hofstede’s work 1980, which is the most extensively alluded to work in presence on a comparative subject. To make public social profiles, Hofstede used a five estimations gadget (Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Uncertainty avoidance, Long-term orientation).

Error orientation has been related to organizations’ safety and quality culture. The present study examined country-level differences in error orientation and its relation to cultural values and personality dimensions. The sample consisted of employees (N = 464) working for an international enterprise. The employees were located in eight different countries: China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, USA, and Vietnam. Significant country-level differences in mean error orientation were found, e.g. USA reported the highest mean level, Japan the lowest. All cultural values, but uncertainty avoidance, had a significant relationship with error orientation: employees high in collectivism and long-term orientation had a significantly higher score on error orientation, while employees high in power distance and masculinity showed a significantly lower score. Error orientation also related to personality: employees high in extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness had a significantly higher score on error orientation while employees high in neuroticism showed a significantly lower score. However, both culture and personality could not fully explain the differences in error orientation between countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

National culture can influence the ways managers cope with uncertainty, and their subsequent business decisions, as was described in seminal research by Hofstede (1991). By their very nature, cross-border acquisitions require that managers deal with different cultures and higher levels of uncertainty. We seek to understand how national culture affects value in cross-border acquisitions using data from the Asia-Pacific Rim region over the period between 2000 and 2009. The countries of this region have large cultural differences and the potential gains from acquisitions are very substantial, so these data are an excellent population for analysis. Our results show that different national cultures have an important influence on financial decisions by firms in ways consistent with classic research by Knight (2006), and also that different national cultures cope with uncertainty in different ways. We find that acquirers from countries with a high aversion to uncertainty conduct fewer cross-border acquisitions. Further, these high uncertainty aversion firms pay a higher price for control in cross-border deals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

As well, the process of semiotic mediation entails signs constraining and enhancing both interpersonal and intrapersonal psychological processes and experiences, including through nested systems (the levels of the individual-the relationship-the community-the societal). We present data for Australia and Thailand on Hofstede’s six culture dimensions, that is, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, short-term/long-term orientation & restraint/indulgence. An idealized and dynamic model of relations of Hofstede’s six culture dimensions and four indeterminate pronouns (e.g., ‘every’-one, ‘some’-one, ‘any’-one, ‘no’ one) is proposed. As a framework for construing the complex semiotic organization of (western, English-speaking) culture and psyche, four “cyclical” regulatory statements are outlined, regarding personal constraint, personal enhancement, cultural constraint, and cultural enhancement in language and culture, that is, in semiotic cultural psychology.

The meta-analysis is based on 489 effect sizes taken from 123 manuscripts. The findings show that organizations with a market culture show the highest new product performance, while hierarchy-type organizations show the lowest performance. The influence of national culture variables supports the effect of value congruency, and shows that in individualistic cultures the impact of a clan culture decreases, the impact of an adhocracy culture type decreases with uncertainty avoidance, and the influence of a hierarchy culture type increases with power distance. The superior effect of a market culture type can be matched by other organizational orientations, but in particular national cultures only. The combined findings underline the importance for firms that seek to improve the success rate of new products on international markets to consider the fit of a national culture with a firm's organizational culture. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association.},

In this way, accounting supervisors influence not only the end users of accounting information, but also subordinates who learn about the accounting profession from them. In investigating collusive supervision, I utilize a field-based instrument and a sample of practicing accounting supervisors. I find that accounting supervisors’ behavioral intentions to encourage their subordinates to collude in manipulating accounting information are influenced by attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and materialism. I investigate cultural influences on these relationships. I find that power distance and collectivism increase the likelihood that an accounting supervisor will encourage subordinates to collude in manipulating accounting information. Uncertainty avoidance, or rule orientation, decreases the likelihood. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling illustrates direct and indirect cultural effects. The findings suggest that adding relevant cultural variables to the Theory of Planned Behavior and considering related mediation effects can increase the framework’s capacity to explain behaviors in international or cross-cultural settings.

There however remains a research gap in assessing how within-group, intra-cultural variations between individual values and attitudes can affect the attribution of accident causes, particularly in culturally diverse environments. The present research involved thirty (N = 30) accident investigators’ categorisation of causal factors of the same incident using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) [1]. Rather than using geopolitical countries to categorise participants into groups, individual cultural values were assessed using Hofstede’s six-dimension model in order to capture intra-cultural variations [2]. The frequency of participants selecting a HFACS category as contributory were compared with their six Hofstede’s dimensions. It was discovered that the attribution of accident causes to categories in the Unsafe Acts of Operators level (HFACS Level 1) were driven by the investigators’ Power Distance and Long-Term Orientation dimensions; categories in the Preconditions of Unsafe Acts level (HFACS Level 2) were unaffected by investigators’ Hofstede’s dimensions; and the higher HFACS levels concerning supervisory and organisational influences (Levels 3 and 4) were moderated by Uncertainty Avoidance and Long-Term Orientation. Findings of the present research can provide insight into sources of bias in accident investigations and inform adjustments for consequential training and operational changes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Attempts within the prior studies to determine whether the disparities in national saving rates can be explained by cultural attributes have been largely unsuccessful, essentially as a result of the formidable problems of measurement of culture, data availability and endogeneity. We first extend the prior research using the six measurable cultural dimensions of Hofstede et al. [(2010). Culture and Organizations: Software of the Mind, Intercultural Cooperation and Its Importance for Survival, 3rd Edition. New York: McGraw Hill], along with the largest panel database currently available, containing 84 countries over the period 1981-2012, on culture-related variables and saving rates, to test our hypothesis that cultural factors can influence private saving behavior in an international context. We then focus our study on three main cultural variables in East Asian countries - Confucianism, Long-term Orientation (LTO) and Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) - and find that they all have significant impacts on private saving rates around the world. Our findings also potentially solve the puzzle of why China, Japan and other East Asian countries save so much and so persistently since we find that the high LTO measures within these regions determine their high levels of private savings, whilst their low UA measures explain the persistence of their high saving rates, even during a period of financial crisis.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {Background: Taking patient centeredness into account is important in healthcare. The European Cancer Consumer Quality Index (ECCQI) is a validated tool for international benchmarking of patient experiences and satisfaction. This study aimed to further validate the ECCQI in larger and more uniform groups of high volume tumours such as breast and prostate cancer. A second objective was the verification of the influence of cultural factors of the country to determine its possible use in international benchmarking. Methods: Data from two survey studies in eight European countries were combined. Socio-demographic correlations were analysed with Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to validate internal consistency. Influences of masculinity (MAS), power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) were determined by linear regression analysis in a general model and subgroup models. Results: A total of 1322 surveys were included in the analysis (1093 breast- and 348 prostate cancer patients). Cronbach’s alpha was good (α ≥ 0.7) or acceptable (0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.7) in 8 out of 9 questionnaire categories, except in the category ‘Safety’ (α = 0.305). Overall ECCQI scores ranged from 22.1 to 25.1 between countries on a 1–35 scale (categories had a 1–4 scale). In certain subcategories such as ‘Organisation’ (range 2.2 vs 3.0) and ‘Supervision & Support’ (range 3.0 vs 3.8) a large difference was observed between countries. Differences in ‘Overall opinion’ were however small: mean scores of 3.7 vs 3.9, whereas median scores were all the maximum of 4.0. Power distance was positively associated with higher patient satisfaction scores whereas Uncertainty avoidance was negatively associated with these scores. Masculinity was only associated with patient satisfaction scores in lower educated patients. We found the highest impact of culture on overall scores in Hungary and Portugal and the lowest in Romania. Conclusions: The ECCQI shows high internal consistency in all categories except ‘Safety’. Especially in separate categories and overall ECCQI scores the questionnaire showed discriminative value. This study showed a positive correlation of power distance and a negative correlation for uncertainty avoidance in some countries. When using the ECCQI for international benchmarking these two dimensions of culture should be taken into account. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Further, measuring the national culture with the uncertainty avoidance index (the aspect of national culture which measures the cross-country differences in decision-making under stress and ambiguity), we find that the negative impact of investors’ attention on stock market returns is stronger in countries where investors possess higher uncertainty avoidance cultural values.

To determine how to enhance school agency for the policy, we explored the individual and contextual factors affecting receptivity to the new curriculum. With a survey design, this study recruited secondary school teachers and principals throughout Taiwan as samples. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to examine the effects of individual factors (conceptions of distributed leadership and collective learning) and organizational culture (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and academic emphasis) on practitioners’ receptivity to curriculum reform. Both the main and interactive effects were investigated. The results indicate that respondents who positively conceived distributed leadership and collective learning were more receptive to change. Regarding the three indicators of organizational culture, we found no significant effect of power distance, while the main effect of uncertainty avoidance and the moderation effect of academic emphasis existed. Those who perceived their schools with high uncertainty avoidance levels were more resistant to reform efforts. Besides, a positive linkage between teacher conception of collective learning and affection for change was more evident in schools with less academic emphasis. Our study suggests that school reforms must be understood within the individual and school contexts. The finding about the moderation effect of academic emphasis furthermore signifies the cultural implication in Asian societies. © 2023, De La Salle University.},

More importantly, the uncertainty avoidance was introduced as a moderator between self-congruity and revisit intention. Based on the theoretical framework proposed in this article, the estimated results affirmed the applicability of the theory of self-congruity for tourism research. Moreover, by extending the theoretical model through the incorporation of a variable of uncertainty avoidance in the context of tourism, this article offers a significant contribution to the tourism literature. It is important to understand how the theory of self-congruity applies across a broad cultural spectrum.

Previous research suggests that national culture may exert an independent influence on individuals’ PSM. This article examines PSM as an individual-level variable that is related to national culture, which is represented by Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme (2005), I investigate the relationship between cultural dimensions and individuals’ PSM. This article demonstrates that masculinity and indulgence are positively related to individuals’ PSM, whereas individualism is negatively associated with individuals’ PSM. However, power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a non-significant relationship with PSM. This article provides partial support for the thesis that national culture is associated with individuals’ PSM, but future research is required to explicate the relationship of cultural characteristics to individuals’ PSM. Points for practitioners: Culture influences certain types of behavior both directly and indirectly. The article suggests that cultural tendencies such as masculinity, indulgence, and collectivism have a significant positive influence on individuals’ PSM. Organizational education and socialization enhancing these cultural values are likely to foster employees’ PSM. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.},

Uncertainty avoidance (UA) was positively associated with the percentage of older adults in all three decades and negatively associated with the total fertility rate in the 1990s. Interactions between UA and GDP were significant for the percentage of female older adults in the 1990s and 2000s, male and female life expectancy, and the total fertility rate in the 1990s. UA was positively associated with life expectancy and negatively associated with the total fertility rate in countries with higher GDP, but not in countries with lower GDP.

This study explores the hypothesis that national culture influences the flexibility of (medical) schools in terms of their propensity to adopt integrated and PBL curricula. Methods: National culture was defined by a country's scores on indexes for 4 dimensions of culture as described by Hofstede, defined as: power distance; individualism/collectivism; masculinity/femininity, and uncertainty avoidance. Non-integrated medical curricula were defined as those that included courses in 2 of the 3 basic sciences (anatomy, biochemistry and physiology) in the first 2 years; otherwise, by exclusion, curricula were assumed to be integrated. The medical curricula of 134 of the 263 schools in the 17 European countries included in Hofstede's study were examined. Results: Correlations were calculated between the percentage of integrated medical curricula in a country and that country's scores on indexes for each of the 4 dimensions of culture. Significant negative correlations were found between the percentage of integrated curricula and scores on the power distance index (correlation coefficient [CC]: - 0.692; P = 0.002) and the uncertainty avoidance index (CC: - 0.704; P = 0.002). No significant correlations were found between the percentage of integrated curricula and scores on the indexes for individualism/collectivism and masculinity/femininity. Conclusions: A (medical) school which is considering adopting an integrated or PBL curriculum and which is based in a country with a high score on Hofstede's power distance index and/or uncertainty avoidance index must a priori design strategies to reduce or overcome the obstructive effects of these dimensions of culture on the school's organisation. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.},

Comparing data collected from 308 respondents in Italy and the US, the different cultural characteristics of uncertainty avoidance and high/low context were examined for their influence on media capabilities identified in MST and their contribution to synchronicity. Results show that for US respondents, four of the five media capabilities have a significant association, while for Italian respondents, only two of the five media capabilities have a significant association. This research suggests that contextual differences based on cultures exist in the way MST operates and that culture should be considered in theorizing with respect to MST.},

Hospitality leaders may need to be emotionally intelligent or self-aware in order to be perceived as effective leaders. This study examines whether self-awareness, one important facet of emotional intelligence relates to perceptions of leadership effectiveness for hospitality leaders taking cultural context into consideration (e.g., uncertainty avoidance, performance orientation, and in-group collectivism).

Results indicate that self-awareness resulted in increased perceptions of leader effectiveness in all but one of the cultural conditions of this research, even when the quality of the work relationship between leader and others was first taken into account. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Specifically, we hypothesize that uncertainty avoidance culture, communication, shared decision making, team style work design, and human resource policies are critical antecedents of knowledge augmentation and adaptation, which in turns lead to better IS performance. The results show that while knowledge adaptation can be enhanced by uncertainty avoidance culture and communication, knowledge augmentation is a function of shared decisionmaking, use of team, and innovation-based policies. The results serve as guidance for managers to choose needed HRM practices to boost desired uncommon knowledge use style.},

	abstract = {Persistent differences in the level of business ownership across countries have attracted the attention of scientific as well as political debate. Cultural as well as economic influences are assumed to play a role. This paper deals with the influence of cultural attitudes towards uncertainty on the rate of business ownership across 21 OECD countries. First, the concepts of uncertainty and risk are elaborated, as well as their relevance for entrepreneurship. An occupational choice model is introduced to underpin our reasoning at the macro-level. Second, regression analysis using pooled macro data for 1976, 1990 and 2004 and controlling for several economic variables, yields evidence that uncertainty avoidance is positively correlated with the prevalence of business ownership. According to our model, a restrictive climate of large organizations in high uncertainty avoidance countries pushes individuals striving for autonomy towards self-employment. Regressions for these 3 years separately show that in 2004, this positive correlation is no longer found, indicating that a compensating pull of entrepreneurship in countries with low uncertainty avoidance may have gained momentum in recent years. Third, an interaction term between uncertainty avoidance and GDP per capita in the pooled panel regressions shows that the historical negative relationship between GDP per capita and the level of business ownership is substantially weaker for countries with lower uncertainty avoidance. This suggests that rising opportunity costs of self-employment play a less important role in this cultural environment, or are being compensated by increasing entrepreneurial opportunities. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Research on professional service purchasing generally takes a culturally universalistic approach, implicitly assuming the generalizability of research findings and normative models to different cultural contexts. However, research in related disciplines points to the influence of national culture on managers' decisions, thereby questioning the culturally universalistic approach. The purpose of this paper is to explore differences in professional service purchasing in different cultural contexts. Based on a survey of large organizations, we analyze how the purchasing process for a specific type of professional services - management consulting services - is organized in two cultural contexts (i.e. Germany and Sweden). The results indicate that organizations in Germany and Sweden differ in the way they approach key aspects of the purchasing process. These differences are discussed in relation to two central cultural dimensions - uncertainty avoidance and masculinity-femininity - in which Germany and Sweden take very different positions. It is proposed that uncertainty avoidance mainly influences the first steps in the purchasing process (specify, select and contract) whereas masculinity-femininity mainly influences the remaining steps (order, expedite and evaluate). The paper contributes to the purchasing and supply management literature by empirically illustrating differences in purchasing practices in different cultural contexts and developing theory-driven propositions for the influence of national culture on the professional service purchasing process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Hofstede (2001, Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, insititutions, and organizations across nations, 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and the capability of initiating innovation measured by the number of patent applications using the sample of European countries at the regional level. As a novel approach, instead of using Hofstede's original index scores, the measures for the cultural dimensions are based on the European Social Survey. We have learned that to be successful in patenting, a region should have power distance, uncertainty avoidance, family-related collectivism (as opposed to friend-related and organisation-related collectivism), and lower than average masculinity. In addition, the negative relationships between these cultural dimensions and patenting are stronger when there is a higher patenting intensity. However, culture alone does not serve as a guarantee for a high level of patenting intensity. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

Little work has been done so far to examine the effects of national culture on entrepreneurial intentions of citizens in the same country. This study fills this gap by examining the effects of Hofstede (1984) national culture's dimensions on entrepreneurial intentions of individual's for the case of Pakistan. The culture dimensions included; power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, collectivism, long/short term orientation. The data has been collected from employees working in various organizations of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling technique has been adopted to analyze the data and to interpret the results. The study found that cultural dimensions including; higher power distance, collectivism, masculinity and short term orientation are having negative effects on organizational performance for the case of Pakistan. The study has discussed the important implications of national culture's dimensions to improve the organizational performance.},

We propose a theoretical framework that links CEO risk tolerance to the expected net synergies. We empirically show that CEOs of firms located in countries with lower levels of risk tolerance, measured by Hofstede's (1980, 2001) uncertainty avoidance score, require higher premiums on takeovers, and show that uncertainty avoidance plays a greater role in relatively large takeovers. Additional testing reveals that CEOs from high uncertainty avoiding nations engage less in cross-border/cross-industry takeovers, suggesting that uncertainty avoidance captures more the CEO's risk perception than his/her risk aversion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Metacognition, the observation of one's own thinking, is a key cognitive ability that allows humans to influence and restructure their own thought processes. The influence of culture on metacognitive strategies is a relatively new topic. Using Antonietti's, Ignazi's and Perego's questionnaire on metacognitive knowledge about problem-solving strategies (2000), five strategies in three life domains were assessed among student samples in Brazil, India, and the United States (N=317), regarding the frequency, facility, and efficacy of these strategies. To investigate cross-cultural similarities and differences in strategy use, nationality and uncertainty avoidance values were independent variables. Uncertainty avoidance was expected to lead to high frequency of decision strategies. However, results showed no effect of uncertainty avoidance on frequency, but an effect on facility of metacognitive strategies. Comparing the three cultural samples, all rated analogy as the most frequent strategy. Only in the U.S. sample, analogy was also rated as the most effective and easy to apply strategy. Every cultural group showed a different preference regarding what metacognitive strategy was most effective. Indian participants found the free production strategy to be more effective, and Indian and Brazilian participants found the combination strategy to be more effective compared to the U.S. participants. As key abilities for the five strategies, Indians rated speed, Brazilians rated synthesis, and U.S. participants rated critical thinking as more important than the other participants. These results reflect the embedded nature and functionality of problem-solving strategies in specific cultural environments. The findings will be discussed referring to an eco-cultural framework. © Koninklijke Brill NV.},

	abstract = {Transaction cost economics (TCE) is probably the most widely accepted theory on how firms can gain competitive advantage through efficient organization of their economic transactions. However, by focusing on the competitive environment in which companies operate, it abstracts from the cultural context in which governance decisions are made. We study the cultural boundedness of TCE using two seminal cultural theories: the political science/sociology framework of Inglehart and the management science framework of Hofstede. We use these theories to develop (main-effect) hypotheses about the cultural contexts in which TCE has higher predictive power as well as (interaction) hypotheses regarding particular cultural contexts that may inherently be more inclined than others to adopt certain non-market governance modes if the market "fails." Hypotheses are tested using a meta-analysis on data collected from 128 studies from 12 countries on 3 continents, representing governance decisions of 60,926 companies. We find that TCE is a universal theory across all cultural contexts. This being said, we find that in societies low on power distance and in societies characterized by a strong emphasis on secular-rational and self-expression values, companies are more strongly guided in their governance decisions by economic, transaction-cost considerations than companies in societies high on power distance and in countries that are characterized by traditional and survival values. Further, TCE's power to predict the specific type of non-market governance employed by the firm is systematically moderated by the national culture in which the firm operates. The power of TCE for predicting hierarchical governance is higher in countries that rate high on secular-rational values and on uncertainty avoidance and low on long-term orientation, whereas TCE is more diagnostic for predicting relational governance in countries high on self-expression values and low on power distance and on uncertainty avoidance. In sum, our meta-analysis provides support for our thesis that to fully understand governance choices made by firms, we need to integrate TCE and cultural theory. While managers around the world are guided by economic considerations, the cultural context in which they operate exerts a substantial-and predictable-contingent effect on their governance choices. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.},

Results showed that national values explained PA strategies, confirming all related study hypotheses. Generally, values such as power distance, future orientation, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism explained the use of different PA systems. Organizational characteristics were also related to PA. In addition, we found interactions between national values and PA programs on organizational outcomes that supported the study's hypotheses.

In Jordan data were collected by means of Harrison and Stokes survey for diagnosing organizational culture, the same instrument used in the USA and in South Africa. The study concludes by suggesting that in certain countries the national culture's effects may appear in a particular dominant organizational culture, that is desired by the management, but not actually preferred by employees.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of culture on information security in a developing country's view. Design/methodology/ approach - Two questionnaires adopted from the GLOBE project and OCAI were used to collect quantitative data on national and organisational culture. Also, a face to face semi-structured interview was used to get insight into deep-rooted issues concerning information security in the study environment. In addition, a previous study was used to find correlation of the data in this study. Findings - The findings show that national culture has more influence than organisation culture on information security. We find that the dimensions that influence information security are Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, In-Group Collectivism, and Future Orientation. Research limitations/implications - This research was conducted in a public sector environment with employees thereby limiting external validity. Also, the population of the survey was small to make a generalisation of the findings. Also, the length of the questionnaire and complexity of questions put off many potential respondents. Practical implications - Culture has impact on information security implementation and therefore the results imply that some consideration should be given when implementing information security models. Originality/value - This study is important because it empirically correlates information security with cultural dimensions in a developing country's environment.

Equity alliances provide supporting mechanisms that quell fears about organizational risk in alliances under conditions of uncertainty avoidance as the dominant cultural-cognitive frame, and hence contribute to better innovation performance. Contractual alliances are associated with higher levels of innovation under normative contexts that value collectivism rather than individualism. •Contrary to expectation, the results do not support the literature of a fit between equity alliances and weak intellectual property rights protection on innovation. However, the presence of highly formalized legal processes for enforcing contracts is associated with higher levels of innovation from alliances. © 2011 Gabler Verlag.},

We collected data using a survey and then analysed it using structural equation modelling. According to the obtained results, initial trust in internet banking services was significantly affected by: (i) factors obtained from the trust literature, which are disposition to trust, organisational structural assurance, and reputation. (ii) Relative advantages, which was adopted from the diffusion of innovation theory. (iii) Uncertainty avoidance, which is a dimension of national culture. Also, analysis of results showed a high impact of initial trust in IBS on the intention to use it. However, unlike developed countries, we found that some factors not to have noticeable influence on initial trust in IBS, such as: technical structural assurance and individualism versus collectivism.},

Experiential learning theory is used to describe the learning process and the Kolb Learning Style Inventory is used to assess differences in how individuals learn. Using the framework for categorizing cultural differences from the Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness (GLOBE) study, national cultures are examined by cultural clusters and individual cultural dimensions. The first part of the study assesses the relative influence of culture in comparison to gender, age, level of education and area of specialization of 533 respondents born in and currently residing in 7 nations. We found that a significant portion of the variance in the preference for abstract conceptualization was explained by culture, gender, level of education and area of specialization. The variability in preference for active experimentation over reflective observation was accounted for by age and area of specialization. The impact of culture was only marginally significant. In the second part of the study where we examined the influence of individual culture dimensions in shaping the learning style preferences, we discovered that individuals tend to have a more abstract learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, institutional collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, future orientation and gender egalitarianism. Individuals may have a more reflective learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and assertiveness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Psychological empowerment has been portrayed as holding the key to unleashing individual potential for performance improvement in project settings, yet individuals with values at variance with the principles of empowerment may not be suitable candidates. The relationship between seven factors related to an individual's cultural values, status, and quality of relationships and psychological empowerment are explored with a sample of project management-level staff in Hong Kong using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Results indicate that individual-level factors matter in psychological empowerment experiences in project settings. In particular, culture may be a key boundary condition in making the implementation of empowerment acceptable and effective in different contexts - although the specific influence of cultural values such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and collectivism/individualism still requires further research to confirm. Building quality relationships between leaders and subordinates, and between subordinates themselves, emerges as a viable root to enhancing psychological empowerment on projects. The study supports findings from cross-cultural studies that show differences in empowerment effects across cultures, and so casts doubts on the convergence hypothesis of management practices across cultures. Building robust social support systems may, however, be fundamental to the successful implementation of empowerment in high power distance and high uncertainty avoidance contexts such as that of Hong Kong and China. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Background: E-health is an important initiative among the public and private hospitals in Bangladesh in the last few years. The factors influencing e-health adoption have been a well-investigated research area in both developed and developing countries. However, there have been only a few studies exploring the role of cultural factors in the adoption and use of e-health, particularly in developing countries. In this study, we investigated the influence of culture on the adoption of e-health in Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: This study developed a more adequate research framework by integrating Hofstede's cultural dimension model and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from respondents in different private and public hospitals in Bangladesh. The partial least squares method, a statistical analysis technique based on the Structural Equation Model, was used to analyze the collected data. Results: The study found that cultural dimensions such as Power Distance, Masculinity, and Restraint had significant impacts on Intention to Use e-Health, whereas Uncertainty Avoidance, Collectivism, and Pragmatism had no significant impact on Intention to Use e-Health in Bangladesh. The results also revealed that Perceived Usefulness was a significant indicator of e-health adoption decisions, whereas Perceived Ease of Use was an insignificant predictor of e-health adoption. Conclusions: The findings of this study may assist governments, organizations, and policy makers to understand the key factors affecting e-health adoption and to develop strategies and policies to enhance e-health services in Bangladesh. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

However, these e-learning solutions are not without cross-cultural challenges. In order to adequately utilize these resources, it is imperative that developers and organizations understand how to address differences in norms, preferences and values of culturally diverse individuals when designing WBI. When instruction does not effectively address student needs, users can be distracted, or even discouraged, from completing instruction and quite possibly reject the technology through which the instruction is delivered. The purpose of this paper is to present an examination of cross cultural challenges in implementing WBI, through a discussion of Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions, cultural technology perceptions, language barriers and user needs. The paper concludes with a discussion the implications of WBI and future trends in WBI design.},

The purpose of this paper is to apply individual-level measurement of cultural orientation, such as power distance and uncertainty avoidance, to the recent findings of computer self-efficacy and ERP adoption belief, such as perceived ease of use, based on the survey of 101 ERP system experts. An online survey methodology is used to gather data from the various industrial fields. The research model is constructed based on the findings of the previous studies in IS, management, and cultural psychology. The results indicate that low power distance and high uncertainty avoidance cultural orientation influence general CSE. In addition, uncertainty avoidance positively influences ease of use of ERP systems. As expected, general CSE positively influences ease of use of ERP systems. Training and managerial interventions through communication to improve these cultural orientations would be effective for the successful ERP systems project. The findings of this research would be helpful to the project managers, IS researchers, and ERP practitioners who want to understand the behavioral aspects of ERP systems adoption in the organization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An additional aim was to investigate the relationship between culture as perceived and culture as desired. Over 800 advanced students of economics, business administration and management from 10 countries participated in the study. They gave free descriptions of an organization they knew well and they rated their native companies on Hofstede's dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and masculinity. In addition, they indicated how they would like their native companies to be on the same dimensions. Both the data concerning the free descriptions and the data concerning the ratings of native companies show considerable support for Hofstede's four dimensions. Remarkably, there was hardly a relation between culture as perceived and culture as desired.

We postulate that culture influences corporate risk-taking both through its effect on managerial decision-making and through its effect on a country's formal institutions. Further, we postulate that the influence of culture is conditioned on the extent of managerial discretion as measured by earnings discretion and firm size. Using firm-level data from 35 countries and employing a hierarchical linear modeling approach to isolate the effects of firm-level and country-level variables, we show that individualism has a positive and significant association, whereas uncertainty avoidance and harmony have negative and significant associations, with corporate risk-taking. Greater earnings discretion strengthens and larger firm size weakens the association of culture with corporate risk-taking. We conclude that even in a highly globalized world with sophisticated managers, culture matters. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a sample of firms from 39 countries, we find that cost stickiness is less pronounced in countries with higher uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation.

	abstract = {Work injuries are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Yet, countries differ dramatically on the prevalence of fatal work injuries (FWIs). Are these differences only a function of national economies and infrastructure or also related to entrenched cultural differences? This study tested whether the cultural dimensions of Hofstede, assessed in the 1970s, predict recent FWI in 22 European countries. We hypothesized that Power-Distance Index (PDI) and Masculinity would be positively correlated with FWI, while Individualism and Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) would be inversely correlated with FWI. We obtained the Hofstede cultural dimensions from Hofstede's online data, and obtained data on prevalence of FWI as well as national income and alcohol consumption. Results revealed that PDI was indeed positively and significantly correlated with FWI (r= 0.611, p< .05) while Individualism was inversely significantly related to FWI (r= -0.604, p< .05), independent of national income and alcohol consumption. Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity turned out not to be significantly correlated with FWI. These results show that cultural differences between countries can independently predict future risk of FWI on an international scale. The results also have implications towards organizational management and prevention management concerning FWI. Our study indicates that self-leadership can be a powerful approach to improve occupational safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Furthermore, results indicate that this effect may be due to an interaction between power distance and social collectivism. The degree of collectivism plays an important role in predicting whether ProMES succeeds in countries with relatively low power distance. In countries that score relatively high in power distance, the intervention succeeds regardless of the degree of collectivism. Lastly, whether a country's level of uncertainty avoidance has implications for the success of ProMES is also explored. Implications are discussed. © 2007 NTL Institute.},

	abstract = {Social science research has focused on polieconomic factors for generalized social trust. Yet psychological research has shown that ecological factors can influence cognition, mood, and behavior. Following Van de Vliert's climatic demands-resources theory, I proposed the view of a climatoeconomic contextualization of generalized social trust. Specifically, I found that the interplay of thermal climates (harshness) and wealth (GDP per capita) was related to generalized social trust, mediated by uncertainty avoidance rather than other cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, and power distance. These findings render direct support to Hofstede's hypothesis that societal cultures are first-stage outcomes of climatic factors and second-stage intermediaries between these climatic factors and the sociopsychological functioning of markets, organizations, groups, and individuals. They also provide important implications for trust theory and climatic demands-resources theory. © The Author(s) 2012.},

Several researchers have provided empirical evidence suggesting that an organization's readiness is one of the most important antecedents of e-business adoption; however, despite often comparable levels of organizational readiness, tremendous variations in the national level of ebusiness adoption can still be observed. We argue that cultural specifics can explain these variations to a great extent, and report results from a pan-European empirical study conducted among 14,065 enterprises from 29 different countries. Measuring culture by Hofstede's (2001) well-known cultural dimensions we are able to show that national culture significantly moderates the relationship of organizational readiness and e-business adoption. Power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance were found to exert a significant influence on the relation between organizational readiness and e-business-adoption. We suggest that decision makers interested in ebusiness consider these cultural effects prior to starting new initiatives. © 2009, Authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Coordination theories analyze market imperfections, organizational contingencies and transactional characteristics to explain the choice of coordination mechanisms. In this article the authors argue that national culture also matters. National culture systematically influences individual preferences, therefore national culture may provide an additional explanation of the choice of coordination mechanisms. The problem is studied in the context of two nations, Sweden and China, and in the context of two coordination mechanisms, market and hierarchical mechanisms. It is suggested that market mechanisms are preferred in cultures characterized by high levels of performance orientation, assertiveness, and in-group collectivism and low levels of institutional collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance. A preference for hierarchical mechanisms is suggested in cultures that have the opposite characteristics. Based on the cultural characteristics of Sweden and China, as identified in the Globe report, this leads to the hypothesis that China is biased towards market mechanisms whereas Sweden is biased towards hierarchical mechanisms. An experimental study was designed to test the hypothesis, involving groups of students of Swedish and Chinese origin. The students performed roles as principals/agents in repeated production. Before each period the pairs negotiated contracts and chose between piece-rate payments (a market mechanism) or fixed-rate payments (a hierarchical mechanism). The result supports the hypothesis. A comparison found that Swedish students preferred hierarchical mechanisms whereas Chinese students preferred market mechanisms. © Håkan Pihl, Marcus Bornholt, Marianne Elfversson, Andreas Johnsson, 2010.},

	abstract = {Background: Earlier studies suggested national culture to be a potential barrier to curriculum reform in medical schools. In particular, Hofstede's cultural dimension 'uncertainty avoidance' had a significant negative relationship with the implementation rate of integrated curricula. Aims: However, some schools succeeded to adopt curriculum changes despite their country's strong uncertainty avoidance. This raised the question: 'How did those schools overcome the barrier of uncertainty avoidance?' Method: Austria offered the combination of a high uncertainty avoidance score and integrated curricula in all its medical schools. Twenty-seven key change agents in four medical universities were interviewed and transcripts analysed using thematic cross-case analysis. Results: Initially, strict national laws and limited autonomy of schools inhibited innovation and fostered an 'excuse culture': 'It's not our fault. It is the ministry's'. A new law increasing university autonomy stimulated reforms. However, just this law would have been insufficient as many faculty still sought to avoid change. A strong need for change, supportive and continuous leadership, and visionary change agents were also deemed essential. Conclusions: In societies with strong uncertainty avoidance strict legislation may enforce resistance to curriculum change. In those countries opposition by faculty can be overcome if national legislation encourages change, provided additional internal factors support the change process. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

We expect a firm's home country culture to have a strong impact on these perceptions, resulting in systematic variation in firm entry timing strategies across firms' country of origin. To this perspective, we integrate extant research which suggests that the host country political environment will also impact entry timing. Our findings support the argument that home country cultural attributes directly influence whether a firm decides to enter a country earlier or later than other firms, and that the host country's political environment moderates these effects. Specifically, we find that firms from high performance orientation and high power distance tend to enter countries earlier on average; we also find that countries with weak political freedoms trigger late-entry strategies for firms from high uncertainty avoidance cultures, but early-entry strategies for firms from collectivist cultures. Our findings are the first in the entry timing literature to examine the role of a firm's home country cultural attributes and underscore the importance of the cultural and political environments on strategic decision-making across diverse home and host country contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, many governments still face the problem of low level adoption of eGovernment websites. It is because the issue of eGovernment adoption is complex and multidimensional in nature. In consequence, it must be carefully addressed not only from technological perspectives but also from social, cultural, and organizational perspectives. The business case for developing sustainable successful eGovernment initiatives critically depends on our knowledge and understanding of how to increase citizen adoption of eGovernment websites. A review of the literature, however, shows that much of extant eGovernment research has focused on eGovernment adoption in developed countries. In consequence, little is known about national cultural factors that may influence eGovernment adoption in developing countries. This knowledge gap is particularly apparent in Jordan. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine national cultural factors that may influence citizen adoption of eGovernment websites in this culturally different part of the world. We developed an integrated model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with Hofstede's national culture dimensions, which is used to evaluate the impact of national culture on eGovernment adoption in this paper. Based on survey data collected from a total of 197 Jordanian citizens, evidence shows that while two cultural dimensions: power distance and uncertainty avoidance had significant impacts on citizens' intention to adopt eGovernment, the other three cultural dimensions: individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation had no discernible impacts. The results also indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude are significant indicators of citizens' intention to use state government services online.},

Drawing on project management practitioner job advertisements placed by 2040 organisations across seven countries and seven industries, we employ Hofstede's national cultural framework to categorise cultural preferences which the organisations persistently replicate in their specifications of desired candidate project management practitioner competency. To map global trends and national variations, data analysis is undertaking and utilising exploratory data analysis, Poisson regression and negative binomial regression are used. The paper finds that specific national cultural dimensions - 'Collectivism', 'Uncertainty Avoidance' and, to a lesser extent, 'Power Distance' - are the most salient cultural denominators for advertised project management positions, while this is not the case with 'Masculinity' and 'Individualism'. The findings raise issues about which organisations should seek to become more culturally intelligent, and which relate to the adaptiveness of the cultural preferences that they articulate through their job advertisements, both to project tasks and to cultural contexts for projects. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

A sample of chief internal auditors from 67 listed companies has been used to examine the direct effect of the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism on the QIA. Evidence was found that organizations, in which power distance and uncertainty avoidance are high, are characterized by lower QIA. The results also show a positive association between individualism and the QIA, indicating that internal audit is largely based on the accomplishments of the individual internal auditors associated with the process. Considering these outcomes from the Saudi Arabian standpoint, where the cultural and economic contexts are underpinned by collectivism rather than individualism, it emerges that it is only comparatively recently that a tradition of governance and audit has started to develop, and that quite particular and strong cultural influences stemming from tribalism and pervasive core traditions beliefs operate to condition the effort to achieve the ideal internal audit environment. ©The Author(s) 2014.},

In Jordan data were collected by means of Harrison and Stokes survey for diagnosing organizational culture, the same instrument used in the USA and in South Africa. The study concludes by suggesting that in certain countries the national culture's effects may appearin a particular dominant organizational culture, that is desired by the management, but not actually preferred by employees. This implies that it is more beneficial for international and transnational corporations to develop “strong” cultures ratherthan to encourage local units to adapt to their national cultures. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data obtained from a secondary source. The dimensions of national culture used in this paper come from Hofstede's work. Two analyses are performed on the data. First, a non-parametric test is conducted to determine whether there are significant differences on the 13 IT security concerns when the dimensions of national culture are used to group responses. Second, a correlation analysis is carried out between the study's variables. Findings - First, the results indicate that the dimensions of national culture are not statistically important in differentiating responses and perceptions of IT security concerns across GFSI. Second, some of the dimensions of national culture are found to have significant correlations with a few of the IT security concerns investigated. Research limitations/implications - The use of a secondary data source introduces some limitations. The views captured in the survey are those of management team, it is likely that end-users' perceptions may vary considerably. Nonetheless, the main finding of the paper for corporate managers in the financial services industry is that IT security concerns appear to be uniform across cultures. Further, the data show that the dimension of uncertainty avoidance deserves further attention with regard to the assessment of security concerns in GFSI. This information may be useful for decision making and planning purposes in the financial services industry. Originality/value - This paper is believed to be among the first to examine the impacts of national culture on IT security concerns in GFSI.

The potentially dynamic nature of national culture, as opposed to a more static approach that is often assumed in management research using a Hofstede framework, is examined. The evidence of relative sample convergence, particularly in relation to collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, along with select, individual region static positions for cultural dimensions provide support for the crossvergence theory [Ralston, D., Holt, D, Terpstra, R., Kai-Cheng, Y., 1997.

Pragmatically the research suggests organizational policies and practices should be updated for maximum effectiveness in relation to crossverging realities and that culture is not static. Academically the research cautions use of approaches that rely on dated rankings for cultural indicators as a basis for current examination since relative cultural positions among regions and nations are also not static. © 2006.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between culture and managers attitude towards business ethics in Nigeria. Several studies have recognized that culture affects ethical behavior. However, very few studies have been conducted on how culture affects managers' attitudes towards business ethics which may predict their ethical behavior especially in developing African countries. The focal point is that this study is to address this knowledge gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - The author collected data from 351 managers in selected firms in Nigeria. Two instruments were used to measure Hofstede's five cultural dimensions and attitudes toward business ethics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test and predict the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables in the study. Findings - Results show that culture has a significant influence on ethical attitudes of managers. The findings also specifically revealed that relationships exist among Hofstede's cultural dimension of power distance, collectivism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, short-term orientation and the dimensions of attitudes towards business ethics. Research limitations/ implications - The generalization of the findings may be limited by some of the sample characteristics. First, the study was limited to six cities in Nigeria; as a result, broader geographic sampling would better represent the national profile. Second, the drop off and pick up method used in data collection and the usual social-desirability bias associated with survey research could be limitations for the study. However, the author took extreme measures to protect the identities of the respondents. Finally, replication of this study using larger samples and a broader geographic base is suggested for cross-validation purposes. Practical implications - Understanding that ethical beliefs and moral decision-making are dependent on culture and play an important role in managing and developing a successful ethics program. The results can help multinational corporations in developing effective culturally based ethical codes of conduct; as well as to design and manage targeted ethical policies and programs that will actively motivate, stimulate, support, encourage, and promote an outstanding ethical organization in Nigeria. Originality/value - There have been very few previous studies on how culture affects managers' attitude toward business ethics within the sub-Saharan African context. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first empirical study on this topic in Nigeria, a sub-Saharan African country. The results provide insights on how culture can influence ethical attitude of managers in Nigeria. As a ground-breaking study on this topic in Nigeria, the findings may provide managers and scholars with an understanding of impact of culture on ethics. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the future research development on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the study is of significant value to practitioners and scholars alike. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

Taking the cultural differences into consideration is critical for a successful Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. The literature indicates that the cultural differences cause difficulties in the implementation of Western ERP software programs in developing countries. In this research, by means of a questionnaire survey, we identified the most influential Critical Success Factors (CSFs) from each dimension of Hofstede cultural dimensions. Considering Iran's scores of Hofstede cultural dimensions, we can support ERP managers and consultants with guidelines on influential CSFs in areas of weak or undesirable cultural dimensions. The findings of our study reveal that Iran's highest ranked dimension, Uncertainty Avoidance, has the most influence on "clear and defined goals and objectives", "organizational support" and "minimal customization". Also Iran's second highest Hofstede ranking dimension, Power Distance, mostly affects "organizational culture", "top management support" and "organizational support".

	abstract = {Building from related interdisciplinary theories, this research identifies social influence–related variables that are linked to customer relationship management (CRM) technology utilization within an international business-to-business field sales force. Field sales employees (n = 147) in a multinational organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were surveyed to test the research model. Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The literature review was based on a multi-disciplinary research approach by incorporating organizational factors, cultural dimensions, and user satisfaction in implementation of ERP for developing countries. The eight ERP software's customers in Thailand were chosen for eleven semi-structured interviews performed during the period of April 2007 to April 2008. The findings confirm that management commitment, IT maturity, and computer culture are important factors influencing user satisfaction of the ERP projects. A company with richer Business Process Redesign (BPR) experience is more likely to succeed with ERP. Interestingly, the collectivism of ERP teamwork and composition is also critical issue for ERP implementation's satisfactions. Dealing with masculinity of users may lead to more satisfactions toward ERP implementation. Solving high uncertainty avoidance tends to boost users confidence and familiarity of users. The findings and recommendations can be useful for developing countries with similar conditions.},

	abstract = {The majority of Websites are constructed with a single homogenous user in mind, or a limited number of user profiles, usually from one country or culture. In order to accommodate the international growth of the Internet, this mono-cultural bias of Website design must change. If crucial steps of user-centered user-interface (UI) development for Websites are omitted, which happens when people unconsciously apply their own rules to interactive communication intended for others, effective communication of the Website will be less successful, or may even be dysfunctional. People from different countries/cultures have certain expectations of a particular site that may differ significantly from other countries/cultures. For example, many middle-class Germans may typically prefer a design that is more subdued and easy to navigate, while many middle-class Mexicans may prefer a more colorful screen and tolerate more ambiguity. The present study is derived from the previous efforts of Marcus and Baumgartner [4, 5], Using five cultural dimensions (from Hofstede, as a useful, well-known set) and the schema of five UI design components, Marcus and Baumgartner created a five-by-five matrix that allowed for twenty-five fields of interest. The authors analyzed 12 corporate business-to-business and business-to-consumer interactive Websites and found patterns in divergence from corporate design standards. Baumgartner, with Marcus' assistance, also analyzed a set of 29 culture dimensions abstracted from nine models and presented to a group of 57 experts. The two authors analyzed the experts' evaluations of the importance of each dimension [2], They reviewed this list to derive which items comprised the top five in levels of importance. "Best of breed" culture dimensions are context, technology, uncertainty avoidance, time perception, and authority conception, in that order. Context is described as the amount and specificity of information in a given communication. The cultural dimension of technology is comprised of the experience of technology and technological development. As a cultural dimension, technology has to do with the development and attitude of the members of a certain society towards technological development. The cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance takes into account the behavior of the user regarding uncertain or unknown situations. Time perception concerns whether one has a long- or short-term orientation to achieving objectives and whether one is oriented to the past, present, or future. This cultural dimension can be related to the perceived amount of time that it takes to comprehend and utilize a © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007 Website. Authority conception concerns how people think of authority and the way their behavior is influenced when reacting to a Web UI design as official and authoritative, or not [4,5]. Hofstede's five cultural indexes include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, gender roles, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term time orientation. Power distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. This index measures whether or not there is a strong representation of inequality of a society. Individualism is the opposite of collectivism. This index demonstrates how loose or tight the ties are between individuals and their society at large. Masculinity is generally understood to be the opposite of femininity. This index refers to the roles people play according to their genders. Uncertainty avoidance concerns a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. This index includes to what extent a culture programs its members to feel either comfortable or uncomfortable in unstructured situations. Long-term time orientation is generally the opposite of short-term time orientation. Long-term time orientation values thrift, education, and perseverance, while short-term time-orientation is concerned more with the achieving short-term goals, fulfilling obligations, and protecting one's self under changing conditions [3]'. This study concerns an analysis of certain (undisclosable) public-facing pages of a financial-related Website by individuals from different countries and cultures. Based on the previously cited studies and after Website design interviews with twenty-four individuals from eleven different countries, the authors of this paper intend to shed light on these two questions: which dimensions seem to have the strongest impact or effect on a particular ethnic group? What considerations about culture should developers take into account when designing Websites for specific cultures/countries? The authors used a working Website and carried out user-preferences tests. Preferences were extracted from a questionnaire of seven distinct questions that were based on the usability of and user opinions of the Website. The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first part inquired about demographic variables. The second part contained questions based on the navigation of the Website. The third part measured the user experience and preferences. The goal of the user tests was to examine whether users with culturally different backgrounds experience and evaluate Websites in a way that is consistent with their culture-specific attributes. The participants selected for this experiment ranged from students to professionals, with an age range of 20-50, all living in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The participants had been living in the United States for less than five years and came directly from their respective countries, which included Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. When comparing the final results with Hofstede's cultural dimensions, the following results became clear: cultural dimensions must be considered in order for a Website to be effective. For example, cultures like Russia and Slovakia, with a high level of power distance find Websites most useful when they have concise language and demonstrate a high level of professionalism. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain and Canada, which have a shorter-term time orientation, desire a Website that is quick to navigate and does not require a lot of time and effort through which to browse. Participants from countries with a high index score for uncertainty avoidance, such as Argentina, France and Mexico, are not trusting of Website content, want Websites that look highly official and professional, want them in their own languages. Countries that ranked relatively higher in individualism, such as Italy, need to have a Website design that is particular to their culture and country. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the effect of organizational culture (OC) on the total quality management (TQM) practices of a Sri Lankan public sector hospital, which practices Japanese 5-S based TQM and has won several national quality awards. Design/methodology/approach - The data are gathered through direct observations, short-time interviews, participative observations, in-depth interviews, and obtaining relevant documentary evidence by the employment of grounded theory. The director, divisional heads, doctors, nursing sisters and nurses, paramedical staff, midwifery staff, clerical staff, and support staff of the hospital are appropriately considered as the informants during the employment of the above data gathering techniques. The data are analyzed qualitatively in line with the research variables. Findings - As cultural characteristics of the hospital, the study identified low power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, low individualism, and low masculinity. The study identified high senior management commitment, high staff commitment, high stakeholder focus, high integration of continuous improvement, high quality culture, high measurement and feedback, and high learning organization characteristics as TQM practices of the hospital. Moreover, the study found that the supportive culture of the hospital has positively impacted on its TQM practices. Research limitations/implications - To overcome the limitations of the OC framework adopted in the present study, the paper invites future studies to examine the issue from a broader and new culture perspective. Originality/value - Recently, many organizations in Sri Lanka irrespective of their category and industry have been practicing TQM in order to stay competitive in both domestic and international markets. But empirical studies on the topic are very limited in the Sri Lankan context. This study as a case of a Sri Lankan public sector hospital aims to fill that gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {We propose a theoretical model to explain how societal/cultural settings may influence the leadership perception processes of followers and the ways perceived leadership effectiveness can be achieved. We adopt five cultural dimensions - collectivism/individualism (CI), masculinity/femininity (MASC), power distance (PD), uncertainty avoidance (UA) and fatalism (FT), and relate them to two types of leadership perception modes - recognition-based and inference-based processes, and perceived leadership effectiveness. Propositions are developed concerning how these cultural dimensions would be expected to influence leadership perception processes. We also discuss our propositions from a multidimensional perspective. We propose that in some cultural settings, fitting leadership behaviors and traits to leadership prototypes will be more likely to lead to perceived leadership effectiveness. In other cultural settings, more positive group or organizational performance outcomes will be more likely to lead to perceived leadership effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these propositions as they are embedded within an organizational context. Copyright © 2005 SAGE Publications.},

Using a sample (n=568) drawn from the banking industry in Finland and Hong Kong, we found that although the effects and predictive capability of culture (i.e. masculinity-femininity, individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance) offered some important insights, a range of other contextual factors (i.e. organizational, institutional, economic) wielded influence over and shaped reward-performance values, preferences, and behaviours. The emergence of these new paradigms necessitates that the US centric economic and behavioural theories (e.g. exchange) that underpin reward-performance be revisited and extended if they are to be applicable in the international context. Understanding the influence of a range of contextual forces is therefore critical to multinational organizations attempting to implement effective reward strategies aimed at achieving a diverse set of performance priorities.

	abstract = {Shakespeare has been widely recognized as a dramaturgist who through his intriguing pageantry of kings presents an effective text of leadership, communication and management that has inspired hosts of modern day business practitioners. Yet it is interesting to note that the management perspective which Shakespeare seems to espouse has emanated from the cultural ethos of his native country, Great Britain. Britain has been portrayed by prominent interculturists such as Geert Hofstede, Fons Trompenaars, Edward T. Hall as a low power distance, weak uncertainty avoidance, low-context culture with high masculinity and individualism index, demonstrating achievement and inner-directed value orientations. Even Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) study in its cultural taxonomy identifies a ramification of Anglo-cluster leadership model with a distinct skill set which includes Great Britain. The character lineaments of Shakespeare's king leaders present congruence with the leadership profiles defined for diverse cultural demarcations by these seminal works on cross-cultural management with remarkable fidelity thereby endorsing the view that culture and leadership are inextricably woven together in a symbiotic engagement. The article applies theories of intercultural management to the leadership, communication and management inferences that can be drawn from the literature of this bard of Avon to reach the conclusion that this master craftsman evinces a strong cultural affiliation to his native country in offering his sagacious exhortations which are designed for an English audience and hence, cannot be transplanted in the Oriental part of the world without indigenizing them in the process of transposition to fit into foreign cultural constructs. Thus, in order to be globally relevant an intercultural reading of Shakespeare has to be practised with systemic mutations in his scripts in order to offer an effective transnational discourse to management practitioners keeping in view the plurality of disparate socio-cultural business contexts. © 2014 Mudra Institute of Communications.},

By drawing on theoretical antecedents in previous IS and culture studies, this paper examines and analyzes cultural impact on ERP utilization in China. The study involved 25 semi-structured interviews in two Chinese companies. The findings identified that China's cultural features of high power distance, low uncertainty avoidance and collectivism, can originate a set of crucial ERP barriers and problems, which are located in diverse management and organizational areas in Chinese companies. The study suggested that, in order to address these cultural obstacles and thus ensure long-term ERP success, Chinese enterprises need to substantially change their traditional business procedures, staff attitudes, and management behaviour. Given that many cultural factors are not unique to a country, the findings of this study should have applicability beyond China. © 2010 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach - Most empirical research on culture dimensions and corruption is based on Hofstede's dataset of culture conducted more than 25 years ago. Evidence from a more recent dataset of culture dimensions is needed before current generalizations can be made. The GLOBE project is based on the perceptions of 18,000 individuals. Findings - The results provide empirical support for the influence of uncertainty avoidance values, human orientation practices, and individual collectivism practices on the level of corruption after controlling for economic and human development, which, in turn, adds to the efforts to build a general theory of the culture perspective of corruption. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer valuable insights on why cultural values and cultural practices should be distinguished as they relate to corruption. Practical implications - International policy makers as well as managers at multinational corporations can benefit from the findings of this research study. Originality/value - The research reported is among the first to investigate the issue of corruption from the perspective of national cultural values and practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The theory and research on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation tends to be dominated by assumptions and values reflective of those dominant in the national culture of the United States, where most of this work is done. This suggests that an underlying theme focuses on how CEO compensation is related to instrumental choices made in a competitive, capitalist culture. This study seeks to expand the understanding of CEO compensation by examining it in the context of other cultures, based on the premise that national culture plays a significant part in the nature of compensation strategies. We relate cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism, and masculinity-femininity) developed by Hofstede (Hofstede 1980a, 2001) to several dimensions of CEO compensation. These dimensions are total CEO pay, the proportion of variable pay to total compensation, and the ratio of CEO pay to the lowest level employees. The main findings of our paper are (1) all of the different dimensions of CEO pay were related to power distance, leading us to infer that CEO pay in a culture is most reflective of the strength of the power structure in a society, and (2) total compensation and the ratio of variable pay to total pay are related to individualism. We conclude that cultural dimensions can contribute to understanding cross-national CEO compensation. The implication of this conclusion is that there are different ways that CEO compensation fits into the cognitive schema of various cultures and, furthermore, that these cognitive schema vary across societies that affect the nature of the "cultural matrix into which [money] is incorporated" (Bloch and Parry 1989, p. 1). Moreover, our results imply that particular forms of CEO compensation do not mean the same thing in different cultures, but rather carry different symbolic connotations depending on the values dominant in a society. Thus, not only does the compensation structure of a firm within a culture have a symbolic meaning within organizations (e.g., Trice and Beyer 1993), but it can also be seen as an expression of deeper social values (Hofstede et al. 1990) that may differ across countries.},

When the user and the expert is in agreement on the issue of power-distance the IT systems provided will be viewed in a more positive light. This hypothesis is tested and confirmed in the present study. A list of twelve statements expressing special IT knowledge and authority was constructed and a sample of IT experts and users were asked to rate their level of agreement with these on a scale 0 to 5. The simple sum of respondent rating was used as a measure of acceptance of IT authority and power. Users were also asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the progress of a new Hospital Information System been implemented. The IT acceptance score of users who were satisfied with implementation progress did not differ from IT personnel but differed significantly from users who were not satisfied with progress.

To contribute to our understanding of the factors driving this diffusion, I study relationships between national values (measured by Hofstede's cultural dimensions) and renewable electricity adoption at the national level. Existing data for 66 nations (representing an equal number of developed and developing economies) are used to fuel the analysis. Somewhat dependent on limited available data on controls for grid reliability and the cost of electricity, I discover that three of Hofstede's dimensions (high uncertainty avoidance, low masculinity-femininity, and high individualism-collectivism) have significant exponential relationships with renewable electricity adoption. The dimension of uncertainty avoidance appears particularly appropriate for practical application. Projects or organizations implementing renewable electricity policy, designs, or construction should particularly attend to this cultural dimension. In particular, as the data imply that renewable technologies are being used to manage risk in electricity supply, geographies with unreliable grids are particularly likely to be open to renewable electricity technologies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify adoption factors of mobile wireless technology to increase interactivity between lecturers and students during lectures. A theoretical framework to ascertain lecturers' intentions to use mobile wireless technology during lectures (dependent variable) is proposed with seven independent variables. The independent variables were ease of use and usefulness from Technology Acceptance Model; trust from Wireless Internet via Mobile Devices model and Mobile Services Acceptance Model; self-efficacy from Social Cognitive Theory; enjoyment from Motivational Model; social influence from Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; and uncertainty avoidance from Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Hofstede et al. in Cultures and organizations: software of the mind, 3rd edn. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2010). Four lecture observations were conducted and interaction barriers identified. Interviews with 22 selected lecturers were conducted to elicit perceptions of mobile wireless technology use during lectures and validate the framework's variables. Interview results from thematic analysis strongly validated mobile wireless technology's usefulness as a supporting, collaboration and real-time interaction tool, especially among introvert students. Ease of use, self-efficacy and enjoyment are supported through familiarity with mobile wireless technology. Majority of the respondents are apprehensive that mobile wireless technology might cause disruptions during lectures, with concerns of redundancy, dependency and misuses amongst students (attributes of uncertainty avoidance). None of the respondents are currently using mobile wireless technology for interaction during lectures, thus lending credence to social influence. Very few respondents agree that use of mobile wireless technology can reduce students' boredom and make lectures more enjoyable, and few perceive intermittent wireless connection will affect user trust. Knowledge of significant mobile wireless technology adoption factors and concerns may be important and applicable to tertiary education in Malaysia. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Design/methodology/approach - Logistic regression analysis based on 440 observations of home-target country dyads collected from websites of nine European airlines, and supplemented by additional sources of macro level indicators. The unit of analysis is the country dyad. Findings - Cultural distance between home and target country, geographical distance between home and target country, website traffic volumes originating from target country, demand conditions in target country, and competition intensity in target country all influence the decision to launch local sites. The cultural dimensions of individualism, masculinity, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance, as well as the legal, commercial and IT infrastructures in target countries don't impact the same decision. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are limited contextually to B2C e-service models, the airline industry and the European origin.

Originality/value - The study shifts the research focus from what constitutes website localization into what dictates localization efforts' implementation. Surprising findings suggest that counter to earlier suggestions, infrastructural conditions and cultural dimensions' levels in target markets do not predict the launch of local sites, and that geographical distance impact decisions related to the geography neutral medium of the internet.

In this context, a tragic event - the Xiaolin Village incident - which occurred during Typhoon Morakot in 2009, a mudslide buried the entire village killing 491 residents in all. This put Taiwans disaster management system to the test. It failed to demonstrate a convincing emergency response. This shock disclosed the misalignment between the disaster management system and de facto interpersonal interactions under the system and pointedly revealed a crucial operational problem in the disjuncture between the system and the government agents. In this paper, Hofstedes cultural dimensions (specifically, power distance and uncertainty avoidance) are employed to explore the influence of culture on the operation of the system. Thirty-two governmental officials were interviewed and their styles of handling conflict assessed using Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. The cultural influence is appraised by detecting the shift of their styles under the emergency situation. Our findings expose the cultural cognitive constraints imposed on individuals by the system and help explain why the actual reactions to the Xiaolin Village incident differed greatly from the expected response. © 2014 Copyright The Chinese Institute of Engineers.},

I analyzed data from 22 studies of MtF transsexualism, conducted in 16 countries, examining the association between percentage of nonhomosexual participants and Hofstede's (Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, and organizations across nations, 2001) Individualism Index (IDV). IDV accounted for 77% of observed variance in the percentage of nonhomosexual MtF participants (r = 0.88, p < .0001). Controlling for differences in national wealth and in Hofstede's other indices of societal values (Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Masculinity) did not significantly change the ability of IDV to account for variance in the percentage of nonhomosexual participants. The factors that contribute to the observed association between societal individualism and the relative prevalence of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism remain to be determined, but a greater tolerance within individualistic countries for socially disruptive gender transitions by nonhomosexual gender dysphoric men, and the availability within many collectivistic countries of socially approved transgender roles for pervasively feminine homosexual gender dysphoric men, are plausible contributors. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In other words, for more effective knowledge sharing, communication competence is required in order to have appropriate conversation.

This empirical research is conducted in order to study the organizational communication competence in a non-western country, Vietnam, and the effect of such competence to the employees' knowledge sharing behavior respectively. Base on the data collected from 11 organizations, the effects of three culture dimensions, namely individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance to the communication competence were statistically analyzed; then, stemming from the certain level of communication competence, the behavior of organizational members towards knowledge sharing was explained.},

Recently, the role accountability plays in organizational decision making has received attention in the literature. Accountability, defined as the pressure to justify one’s decisions to others (Tetlock 1983), is a fact of organizational life and should be incorporated into the research on organizational decision making. However, while these studies shed light on the real-world context in which organizational decision makers decide, they generally ignore the influence of culture on accountability and its outcomes. This presents a serious limitation since the specific norms, values, and ideologies to which people are held accountable differ dramatically from one culture to the next. Therefore, what is considered a socially acceptable justification for behavior likely depends on social contextual factors such as “cultural system” ideologies (Tetlock 1985, p. 308). In other words, the steps decision makers take to cope with demands for accountability may depend upon cultural factors. © 2015, The Academy of Marketing Science.},

	abstract = {Background: Historically, overseas-qualified doctors have been essential for meeting service needs in the UK National Health Service (NHS). However, these doctors encounter many cultural differences, in relation to training, the healthcare system and the doctor-patient relationship and training. Aim: To examine whether Hofstede's cultural model may help us understand the changes doctors from other countries experience on coming to work in the UK, and to identify implications for supervisors and clinical teams. Method: Telephone interviews were conducted with overseas medical graduates before starting work as a Foundation Year One (F1) doctor, followed up after four months and 12 months; and with educational supervisors. Data were analysed using a confirmatory thematic approach. Results: Sixty-four initial interviews were conducted with overseas doctors, 56 after four months, and 32 after 12 months. Twelve interviews were conducted with educational supervisors. The changes doctors experienced related particularly to Hofstede's dimensions of power distance (e.g. in relation to workplace hierarchies and inter-professional relationships), uncertainty avoidance (e.g. regarding ways of interacting) and individualism-collectivism (e.g., regarding doctor-patient/family relationship; assertiveness of individuals). Conclusion: Hofstede's cultural dimensions may help us understand the adaptations some doctors have to make in adjusting to working in the UK NHS. This may promote awareness and understanding and greater 'cultural competence' amongst those working with them or supervising them in their training. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.},

While there have been many reports about the positive outcomes of proactivity, there is much less known about the antecedents, particularly those related to culture. Design/methodology/approach: Sales employees (n=147) in a multi-national organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA were surveyed to assess the impact of cultural trait influences on proactive behavior at the individual level. Using linear regression and partial least squares structural equation modeling, three independent variables were found to be significant antecedents to proactive behavior. Findings: Long-term orientation positively influenced proactive behaviors as did uncertainty avoidance. Uncertainty avoidance was hypothesized to have a negative impact on proactive behaviors, but the results of this study implied that individuals found it safer to adjust to a fluid environment rather than to remain inflexible. No relationship was found between power distance and proactivity. Masculinity was found to be positively related to proactive behaviors but collectivism was not. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study should be limited to its own population and not generalized to larger, more culturally diverse populations which were not represented in the sample. Practical implications: This study provides better understanding of managerial proactive behavior related to cultural traits, particularly in the domain of field sales. Originality/value: This study is unique in that it explores individual proactivity in an organizational selling environment related to cultural traits at the individual level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Although information technology (IT) tools for new product development (NPD) are widely available, prior studies have found the usage of IT to be limited to large-sized firms (cf. Barczak and Sultan, 2006), but increasing (Cooper, 2007). Extant research indicates that several factors influence IT usage, including the existence of a champion and NPD process formalization (Barczak, Sultan, and Hultink, 2007; Barczak, Hultink, and Sultan, 2008). In addition, the antecedents to IT usage have been found to vary among countries (Barczak, Hultink, and Sultan, 2008); that is, they are context-specific. This study extends prior research by exploring the factors that facilitate and/or inhibit IT usage for NPD in Japanese firms. Japan was chosen for this study because it has been argued that, in order to develop generalized NPD theories applicable across different nations or cultures, further understanding is needed about countries other than North American and Western European countries (Song and Parry, 1996; Song, Kawakami, and Stringfellow, 2010). Additionally, the culture of Japan is known for being very different from North America and other Western countries, particularly in terms of Japan's relative emphasis on the collective as opposed to the individual; high in uncertainty avoidance as opposed to low uncertainty avoidance; and long-term orientation rather than short-term orientation (Hofstede, 2005; Kawakami, Maclachlan, and Stringfellow, forthcoming). The lack of research in Japan on IT and NPD implied the need for an exploratory, grounded theory approach to this study. Using a multiple case study method, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 marketing, R&D, and IT managers and executives in 19 firms in a variety of industries. Based on the analysis of the interview data and the follow-up surveys, the authors propose that ten factors in five categories, namely, strategic factors, market environment factors, development process factors, organizational factors, and technology-human interaction factors, are likely to influence IT usage for NPD in Japanese companies. Specifically, product innovativeness, extent of global engagement, formalized IT ROI measure, standardization of NPD activities, physical proximity, resistance to change, CIO as an executive sponsor, sensory requirements, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness are expected to influence IT usage. From a theoretical perspective, this study extends prior research on IT usage by expanding the cultural context beyond North America and Western Europe by focusing on an Asian country, namely Japan. It also adds to the limited research that integrates national culture and NPD and enables the development of a conceptual model that could be tested empirically. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.},

Given the widely recognized effect of cultural values on adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), this study, applying Hofstede's multidimensional framework, investigated the effect of cultural values on the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption in micro level. The empirical examination of the research model indicated that the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption is determined directly by five internal beliefs, including perceived needs, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, perceived resources, and perceived image. The results provide supporting empirical evidence linking most of Hofstede's cultural dimensions to behavioral intention to household Internet adoption. With the exception of power distance, the results showed that collectivism (low individualism), masculinity, long-term orientation, and uncertainty avoidance had significant effects on the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption. The results demonstrated differences in the driving forces and cultural impact on Internet adoption between households and organizations settings. © 2013, IGI Global.},

This paper investigates two competing theories explaining stability versus flexibility in 40 German business students, 51 U.S. business students, and 66 U.S. psychology students. Following cross-cultural psychological research, German students should have higher levels of uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 2001), more intolerant of ambiguities, and less flexible in their decisions when compared to their U.S. business and psychology counterparts. Following research on expertise and the deliberate practice theory (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993), German and U.S. business students should show more flexible strategies when compared to the U.S. psychology student novices. Participants took the role of managers in the computer-simulated company CHOCO FINE and worked on 24 simulated months of the simulation individually over a period of 2 hours. Surprisingly, the German sample was actually less intolerant of ambiguity than the two U.S. samples. Uncertainty avoidance and intolerance of ambiguity did not predict DDM intensity or flexibility. Results showed crosscultural differences but no differences between novices and experts. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {It is noted that four cultural dimensions greatly influence communication in multicultural markets: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism/collectivism, and masculinity/femininity. These dimensions influence such key behavioral processes as motivation and leadership. The authors examines how organizations operating in multicultural markets deal with these challenges through the use of approaches such as cultural assimilators. An example of a cultural assimilator situation is presented.},
