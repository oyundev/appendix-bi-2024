PHI consumption is positively associated with financial development and cultural–social–economic factors, such as income, education, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation, whereas it is negatively associated with public health spending, masculinity, indulgence, and power distance. In addition, factors related to the health environment, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have a negative influence on PHI consumption in the selected OECD economies owing to losses in income. Our findings can serve as guidance for consumers and recommendations for health insurers and policymakers in designing health insurance policies and programs in developed and developing countries. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19 pandemic; Culture; Financial development; Private health insurance","","Amaghionyeodiwe L.A., Determinants of the choice of health care provider in Nigeria, Health Care Management Science, 11, 3, pp. 215-227, (2008); Andries A.M., Ongena S., Sprincean N., The COVID-19 pandemic and sovereign bond risk, The North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 58, (2021); Aon, Weather, climate & catastrophe insight – Annual report.

In keeping with this view, the current study focuses on new product development (NPD) portfolio planning, which is defined as a firm's effort to formulate portfolio decisions using a defined innovation strategy. Connecting portfolio decisions to a defined innovation strategy has been associated with higher innovation success. Surprisingly, empirical research indicates that portfolio decisions do not always support the company's innovation strategy. Furthermore, during recent years, an increasing number of authors underscore the importance of responsiveness and adaptability in portfolio decision-making. The current study addresses these two issues by examining a direct effect of decentralization in strategy-making on NPD portfolio planning, and a moderating effect of decentralization in strategy-making on the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. The study also examines the influence of national culture on the proposed relationships. The theoretical model was tested using data from the 2012 PDMA Comparative Performance Assessment Study. Findings indicate that NPD portfolio planning positively influences NPD program success. Also, results revealed inverted U-shaped direct and moderating effects, respectively, of decentralization in strategy-making on NPD portfolio planning, and of decentralization in strategy-making on the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. With regard to the moderating effect of national culture, results indicate that uncertainty avoidance does not moderate the relationship between NPD portfolio planning and NPD program success. Nonetheless, we found significant moderating effects of individualism and power distance on the curvilinear relationship between decentralization in strategy-making and NPD portfolio planning. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association","","Decision making; Comparative performance assessment; Empirical research; Innovation strategy; New product development; Portfolio decisions; Portfolio planning; Theoretical modeling; Uncertainty avoidance; Product development","Acur N., Kandermir D., Boer H., Strategic alignment and new product development: Drivers and performance effects, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 29, pp. 304-318, (2012); Ahearne M., Lam S.K., Kraus F., Performance impact of middle managers’ adaptive strategy implementation: The role of social capital, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 1, pp. 68-87, (2014); Andersen T.J., Integrating decentralized strategy making and strategic planning processes in dynamic environments, Journal of Management Studies, 41, 8, pp. 1271-1299, (2004); Andersen T.J., Nielsen B.B., Adaptive strategy making: The effects of emergent and intended strategy modes, European Management Review, 6, pp. 94-106, (2009); Barczak G., The future of NPD/innovation research, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 29, 3, pp. 355-357, (2012); Behrens J., A Lack of insight: An experimental analysis of R&D managers’ decision making in innovation portfolio management, Creativity and Innovation Management, 25, 2, pp. 239-250, (2016); Behrens J., Ernst H., Shepherd D.A., The decision to exploit an R&D project: Divergent thinking across middle and senior managers, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 31, 1, pp. 144-158, (2014); Behrens J., Patzelt H., Corporate entrepreneurship managerś project terminations: Integrating portfolio-level, individual-level, and firm-level effects, Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice, (2015); Bertels H.M., Kleinschmidt E.J., Koen P.A., Communities of practice versus organizational climate: Which one matters more to dispersed collaboration in the front end of innovation?, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 28, 5, pp. 757-772, (2011); Blichfeldt B.S., Eskerod P., Project portfolio management—There's more to it than what management enacts, International Journal of Project Management, 26, 4, pp. 357-365, (2008); Burgelman R.A., A process model of internal corporate venturing in the diversified major firm, Administrative Science Quarterly, 28, 2, pp. 223-244, (1983); Chao R.O., Kavadias S., A theoretical framework for managing the new product development portfolio: When and how to use strategic buckets, Management Science, 54, 5, pp. 907-921, (2008); Chow C.W., Shields M.D., Wu A., The importance of national culture in the design of and preference for management controls for multi-national operations, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 24, 5-6, pp. 441-461, (1999); Collier N., Fishwick F., Floyd S.W., Managerial involvement and perceptions of strategy process, Long Range Planning, 37, 1, pp. 67-83, (2004); Cooper R.G., Winning at new products: Creating value through innovation, (2011); Cooper R.G., Edgett S.J., Kleinschmidt E.J., Portfolio management in new product development: Lessons from the leaders-II, Research Technology Management, 40, 6, pp. 43-52, (1997); Cooper R.G., Edgett S.J., Kleinschmidt E.J., Best practices for managing R&D portfolios, Research Technology Management, 41, 4, pp. 20-33, (1998); Cooper R.G., Edgett S.J., Kleinschmidt E.J., New product portfolio management: Practices and performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 6, 4, pp. 333-351, (1999); Cooper R.G., Edgett S.J., Kleinschmidt E.J., Portfolio management for new product development: Results of an industry practices study, R&D Management, 31, 4, pp. 361-380, (2001); Cote J.A., Buckley M.R., Estimating trait, method, and error variance: Generalizing across 70 construct validation studies, Journal of Marketing Research, 24, 3, pp. 315-318, (1987); Day G.S., Is it real?

This article aims to analyze how culture can influence IT Governance implementation of structure, process and relational mechanisms in the context of higher education. Ten case studies in universities from three different countries: Brazil, Portugal and Netherlands were carried out. The purpose is the identification of relevant differences in IT Governance implementation among organizations from the following cultures: uncertainty avoidance and individualism. This article concludes by presenting key contributions, limitations and future work. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a cross-sectional survey research design. Data were collected through 236 validly filled questionnaires by expatriates working in different industries in Nigeria. The research variables were measured using appropriate validated scales developed by different experts. Data collected were analyzed using frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to establish the relationships among the variables. Findings: The study found that the distance between expatriates’ home and Nigeria on each of the dimensions of cultural values: power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance cultural value, long-term orientation and indulgence negatively influence the psychological adjustment of the expatriates in Nigeria. The study demonstrated that the larger the distance between expatriates’ home and Nigeria's cultural values, the larger the difficulties in the psychological adjustment of expatriates in the country. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights and a better understanding to both present and future global human resource practitioners, multinational organizations, international institutions and local organizations operating in Nigeria with a global mindset on the cultural profiles of expatriates that are critical to adjust to working, social interactions and living environments in Nigeria. Originality/value: It provides practical guidance to global human resource practitioners and employers on dimensions of cultural values distance between Nigeria and the home countries of expatriates that should be considered when deciding on, searching for, selecting, recruiting and relocating expatriates to work and live in Nigeria. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Expatriates; Multinational corporations; Psychological adjustment; Social supports","","Abdul-Malek M., Budhwar P., Reiche B.S., Sources of support and expatriation: a multiple stakeholder perspective of expatriate adjustment and performance in Malaysia, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 26, 2, pp. 258-276, (2015); Akhimien G.O., Umemezia E., Demographic profiles for cross-cultural adjustment of expatriates in Nigeria, Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Economics and Business, 9, 1, pp. 25-49, (2021); Arman G., Aycan Z., Host country nationals' attitudes toward expatriates: development of a measure, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 24, 15, pp. 2927-2947, (2013); Beugelsdijk S., Ambos B., Nell P.C., Conceptualizing and measuring distance in international business research: recurring questions and best practice guidelines, Journal of International Business Studies, 49, 9, pp. 1113-1137, (2018); Bolat T., Seymen A.O., Bolat O., Yuksel M., The relationship between cultural distance and expatriate burnout: the moderating effect of cultural intelligence, Social Sciences Studies Journal, 3, 10, pp. 1480-1493, (2017); Bryman A., Cramer D., Quantitative Data Analysis with SPSS for Windows: A Guide for Social Scientists, (1997); Caligiuri P., Baytalskaya N., Lazarova M.B., Cultural humility and low ethnocentrism as facilitators of expatriate performance, Journal of Global Mobility, 4, 1, pp. 4-17, (2016); Chen G., Kirkman B.L., Kim K., Farh C.I., Tangirala S., When does cross-cultural motivation enhance expatriate effectiveness?

Given that societal characteristics can influence individuals' cognitive structures and, to a lesser extent, values in a culture, we address this gap in the literature and argue that individuals' strain in reaction to job resources may differ across cultures. Specifically, we theorize that the societal cultural dimensions of individualism–collectivism and uncertainty avoidance shape individual-level job resource–strain relationships, as they dictate which types of resources (i.e., individual vs. group preference-oriented and uncertainty-reducing vs. not) are more likely to be valued, used, or effective in combating strain within a culture. Results revealed that societal individualism–collectivism and uncertainty avoidance independently moderated the relationships between certain job resources (i.e., job control, participation in decision making, and clear goals and performance feedback) and strain (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intentions). This study expands our understanding of the cross-cultural specificity versus generalizability of the job demands–resources model. © 2017 The Authors Journal of Organizational Behavior Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cross-cultural management; culture; individualism–collectivism; job resources; job satisfaction; multilevel modeling; turnover intentions; uncertainty avoidance","","Adams G., The cultural grounding of personal relationship: Enemyship in North American and West African worlds, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 88, pp. 948-968, (2005); Allen T.D., Johnson R.C., Kiburz K.M., Shockley K.M., Work–family conflict and flexible work arrangements: Deconstructing flexibility, Personnel Psychology, 66, pp. 345-376, (2013); Andreassi J.K., Lawter L., Brockerhoff M., Rutigliano P.J., Cultural impact of human resource practices on job satisfaction: A global study across 48 countries, Cross Cultural.

However, the antecedents of employee self-leadership behaviors in the workplace have been underexplored in the literature, particularly in the context of the hospitality industry. Using the job demands-resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework, this study investigates a hypothesized moderated mediation model that includes the direct effects of organizational empowerment on self-leadership along with the conditional indirect effect of organizational empowerment on self-leadership through self-efficacy, as conditional on the level of employee uncertainty avoidance orientation. A questionnaire survey approach was used to collect data from a sample of 310 employees from 15 four-star and five-star hotels in Guangdong Province, the Southeast of Mainland China. The research results suggest that organization empowerment plays a positive role in enhancing self-leadership through the mediating effects of self-efficacy, with uncertainty avoidance moderating this positive indirect effect. Specifically, for people with low uncertainty avoidance the relationship is much stronger than for people with high uncertainty avoidance. Practical and research implications are discussed along with possible directions for future research. © 2022 The Authors","Organizational empowerment; Self-efficacy; Self-leadership; Uncertainty avoidance","","Abuelhassan A.E., AlGassim A., How organizational justice in the hospitality industry influences proactive customer service performance through general self-efficacy, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, (2022); Afsar B., Masood M., Transformational leadership, creative self-efficacy, trust in supervisor, uncertainty avoidance, and innovative work behavior of nurses, The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 54, 1, pp. 36-61, (2018); Ahearne M., Mathieu J., Rapp A., To empower or not to empower your sales force?

The role of four cultural differences (i.e. individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity) in moderating the motivational correlated relationships is also explored using data retrieved from two distinct cultures (i.e. the USA and Egypt). Design/methodology/approach: Full-time employees (N = 595) in the USA and Egypt were surveyed. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the associations between the two HWI types and four types of motivation (i.e. intrinsic, extrinsic, introjected and identified motivations). Furthermore, moderation analyses were conducted to explore potential effects of four cultural dimensions (i.e. individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity) on the motivationalcorrelated relationships. Findings: Workaholism positively relates to the controlled types of motivation (i.e. extrinsic and introjected regulation), while work engagement positively relates to the autonomous ones (i.e. intrinsic and identified regulation) and negatively associates with extrinsic motivation. Moreover, cultural masculinity moderated the relationship between work engagement and extrinsic motivation, as well as the association between workaholism and extrinsic motivation. Practical implications: A clear differentiation of motivation behind both types of HWI is required by occupational health practitioners to design interventions that stimulate employee engagement rather than fuel workaholism. Multinational organizations could also benefit from understanding the interaction between cultural dimensions, motives and HWI, thereby planning more effective work engagement strategies among different cultures.

Nevertheless, the findings of previous studies are inconsistent. To explain these discrepancies, we performed a meta-analysis of 54 independent studies from January 2010 to April 2023, comprising a total of 14,836 samples, to investigate the impact of OID on UPB and the moderating effects of cultural context. The results of our study demonstrated that individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence play moderating roles in the OID–UPB relationship. This study makes noteworthy theoretical and practical contributions and lays the foundation for future research. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","culture; meta; organizational identification; unethical pro-organizational behavior","article; avoidance behavior; human; individuality; male; masculinity; meta analysis; theoretical study; uncertainty","Alexandra V., Torres M.M., Kovbasyuk O., Addo T.B., Ferreira M.C., The relationship between social cynicism belief, social dominance orientation, and the perception of unethical behavior: A cross-cultural examination in Russia, Portugal, and the United States, Journal of Business Ethics, 146, pp. 545-562, (2017); Alniacik E., Erbas Kelebek E.F., Alniacik U., The moderating role of message framing on the links between organizational identification and unethical pro-organizational behavior, Management Research Review, 45, 4, pp. 502-523, (2021); Ashforth B.E., Harrison S.H., Corley K.G., Identification in organizations: An examination of four fundamental questions, Journal of Management, 34, 3, pp. 325-374, (2008); Ashforth B.E., Mael F., Social identity theory and the organization, Academy of Management Review, 14, 1, pp. 20-39, (1989); Bandura A., Social cognitive theory of self-regulation, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 248-287, (1991); Baur C., Soucek R., Kuhnen U., Baumeister R.F., Unable to Resist the Temptation to Tell the Truth or to Lie for the Organization?

Following a crossvergence perspective, we generate nine causal conditions by accommodating both cultural and institutional varieties: uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, individualism and power distance as culture indicators, and union density, skill development, market capitalization to credit, prevalence of cluster and state dominance as institutional indicators. Applying the configurational approach, we conducted fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. We confirm the equal importance of both cultural and institutional mechanisms as contributors to national innovativeness, and identify equifinal configurations of cultural and institutional varieties as leading to a high-tech society. The implication is that a society can adjust or develop various cultural and/or institutional conditions to maintain or create leadership in innovation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Comparative institutional varieties; Crossvergence; Cultural dimensions; Fuzzy set methods; Innovation","Fuzzy sets; Innovation; International cooperation; Causal conditions; Comparative institutional varieties; Crossvergence; Cultural dimensions; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Market capitalization; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Uncertainty avoidance; Societies and institutions","Acharya V.V., Baghai R.P., Subramanian K.V., Wrongful discharge laws and innovation, Rev.

Although RO enjoys a substantial body of literature considering its application and suitability in different situations, the impact of national culture on the application of RO has received little attention. Values embedded in national culture affect the behavior of managers. In particular, these values play a role in how managers frame information, communicate, and make decisions, directly and indirectly affecting behavior through cultural layers such as organizational culture. National culture, therefore, can systematically affect the application of RO, potentially leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this article, we hypothesize how 2 particularly relevant dimensions of culture, power distance and uncertainty avoidance, affect RO exercise, and estimate the magnitude suboptimality of these effects using a model we develop for the case of a put option. Our estimates suggest RO may not always be a superior valuation approach to net present value for national cultures with certain characteristics. © 2018 The Institute of Behavioral Finance.","National culture;

The culture plays an important role in the managerial decision making and directly influences the IT field. Each organization is based on three fundamental pillars: people, processes and technology, and this holistic model is largely accepted and used in modern present-day organizations. Multiple systems that control the organizational performance and which have as a main focus efficiency improvements of the organizational processes (ITIL, ERP, BI) are adopting this model. Understanding the relationships between people, processes and technology leads to identifying the optimal decisions that must be taken in order to achieve the strategic objectives of the organization. Organizational change - the capability to adapt to environmental transformations - is essential in today’s world and it is determining the survival capacity of the organization on the market. But the resistance to change is a big obstacle in this process and also in the case of adopting a new information technology that is influenced at the same time also by the political authority, rules and legislation, changes in the dynamic of the population and other factors. That is why we are considering that the relationship between the organizational culture and the way of adopting the IT elements can be analyzed by using the Geert Hofstede’s model of dimensions of national culture: power distance index, individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, uncertainty avoidance index, long term orientation versus short term normative orientation, indulgence versus restraint. © 2019, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

These seemingly clear and obvious consequences of smiling are assumed to be culturally universal, however most of the psychological research is carried out in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) and the influence of culture on social perception of nonverbal behavior is still understudied. Here we show that a smiling individual may be judged as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual in cultures low on the GLOBE’s uncertainty avoidance dimension. Furthermore, we show that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling—in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced.

Two separate scenario-based experimental studies were conducted using non-student samples from two culturally diverse countries (Germany and India). Study 1 using 83 participants from Germany and 83 from India shows that when causal explanations for service failure are given, individualists have higher perceived justice. Study 2 with 81 participants from Germany and 82 from India shows that when cognitive control is given through regular updates during service recovery to high uncertainty avoidance seekers, they show higher perceived justice. The three independent justice dimensions positively influence recovery satisfaction, with informational justice showing the strongest impact, followed by procedural and distributive justice. This research thus contributes to the nascent literature in social media complaining. Managers of online service organizations can benefit from these findings when developing their complaint management strategies.

The results indicate that gender empowerment, humane orientation, and institutional collectivism have a larger impact on country risk than democracy, uncertainty avoidance, and gender egalitarianism. The interdependency of some cultural dimensions suggests that cultural and institutional differences could be used to predict mean country risk ratings. © 2017, International Atlantic Economic Society.","Country risk; Culture; Democracy; Gender empowerment; Institutional collectivism","","Altman D.G., Andersen P.K., Bootstrap investigation of the stability of a cox regression model, Statistics in Medicine, 8, 7, pp. 771-783, (1989); Banai M., Cultural, political, and economic Antecedents of country risk in sixty-two countries, Cass-Capco Institute Paper Series on Risk, 34, pp. 89-98, (2012); Barro R., Economic growth in a cross section of countries, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106, May, pp. 407-443, (1991); Barro R., Democracy and growth, Journal of Economic Growth, 1, 1, pp. 1-27, (1996); Bell L.A., Women-led firms and the gender gap in top executive jobs, IZA discussion paper 1689, (2005); Brunnermeier M.K., Sannikov Y., A macroeconomic model with a financial sector, The American Economic Review, 104, 2, pp. 379-421, (2014); Cheston S., Kuhn L., Empowering women through microfinance, (2002); Contractor F.J., Ownership patterns of US joint ventures abroad and the liberalization of foreign government regulations in the 1980s: Evidence from the benchmark surveys, Journal of International Business Studies, 21, 1, pp. 55-73, (1990); Cosset J.C., Roy J., The determinants of country risk ratings.Journal of, International Business Studies, 22, 1, pp. 135-142, (1991); Douglas M., Wildavsky A., Risk and culture: An essay on the selection of technological and environmental dangers, (1983); Eckel C.C., Grossman P.J., Men, women and risk aversion: Experimental evidence, Handbook of experimental economics results, 1, pp. 1061-1073, (2008); Fischhoff B., Lichtenstein S., Slovic P., Derby S.L., Keeney R.L., Acceptable risk, (1981); Freedom in the World Country Rating 2004, Washington D.C. and New York: Freedom House.

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether frontline employees’ (FLEs) individual cultural values moderate the relationship between service models and work behaviours and whether these behaviours influence their psychological well-being. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected online from 341 US and Indian respondents who spent at least 40 per cent of their work time interacting with customers. Cultural values were measured as individual-level constructs. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to test hypotheses. Findings: Individualism/collectivism significantly moderates the relationship between service models and work-related outcome, in particular organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB), while uncertainty avoidance does not. Collectivism strengthens the positive linkage between the win-win service model and OCB but weakens the association of OCB with the efficiency model. FLEs with the win-win model display more surface acting when they have low uncertainty avoidance and high power distance. Employee psychological well-being is then influenced negatively by surface acting, but positively by OCB. Research limitations/implications: A more varied sample covering additional countries and a wider range of industries could provide additional insights. Practical implications: The results of this study are particularly beneficial for service firms that require to satisfy customers by managing culturally diverse FLEs. Originality/value: Extending the limited research on service models, this study examines the interplay of culture and service models and its impact on FLE work behaviours and the resultant well-being. The findings thus provide greater insights in how service employees’ cultural orientations influence their work behaviours and psychological well-being. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Emotional labour; Frontline service employees; Organisational citizenship behaviour; Psychological well-being; Service models","","Akkawanitcha C., Patterson P., A contingency model of ‘face’ loss in service encounters: an Eastern cultural context, Journal of Service Theory and Practice, 27, 6, pp. 1122-1144, (2017); Ashforth B., Humphrey R., Emotional labor in service roles: the influence of identity, Academy of Management Review, 18, 1, pp. 88-115, (1993); Auh S., Menguc B., Spyropoulou S., Wang F., Service employee burnout and engagement: the moderating role of power distance orientation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 44, 6, pp. 726-745, (2016); Bagozzi R., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Baker D., Carson K., The two faces of uncertainty avoidance: attachment and adaptation, Journal of Behavioral and Applied Management, 12, 2, pp. 128-141, (2011); Bargh J., Morsella E., The unconscious mind, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 3, 1, pp. 73-79, (2008); Borman W., Motowidlo S., Task performance and contextual performance: the meaning for personnel selection research, Human Performance, 10, 2, pp. 99-109, (1997); Brettel M., Engelen A., Heinemann F., Vadhanasindhu P., Antecedents of marketing orientation: a cross-cultural comparison, Journal of International Marketing, 16, 2, pp. 84-119, (2008); Brotheridge C., Grandey A., Emotional labor and burnout: comparing two perspectives of people work, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 60, 1, pp. 17-39, (2002); Brotheridge C., Lee R., Development and validation of the emotional labour scale, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 76, 3, pp. 365-379, (2003); Brotheridge C., Taylor I., Cultural differences in emotional labor in flight attendants, Research on Emotion in Organizations, 2, pp. 167-191, (2006); Butler E., Lee T., Gross J., Emotion regulation and culture: are the social consequences of emotion suppression culture-specific?, Emotion, 7, 1, pp. 30-48, (2007); Caplan R., Person-environment fit theory and organizations: commensurate dimensions, time perspectives, and mechanisms, Journal of Vocational Behavior, 31, 3, pp. 248-267, (1987); Caplan R., Harrison R., Person-environment fit theory: some history, recent developments, and future directions, Journal of Social Issues, 49, 4, pp. 253-275, (1993); Chen C., Chen X., Meindl J., How can cooperation be fostered?

We know little, however, about the drivers of cross-functional coopetition and in particular the roles of organizational culture and national culture. This study introduces cross-functional coopetition to the international management literature by illuminating the cultural antecedents of cross-functional coopetition. Specifically, we develop a cross-cultural model to analyze the influence of organizational and national culture on cross-functional coopetition. Drawing on a dataset of 646 companies from seven countries, we theoretically advance and empirically validate the influence of organizational culture and the moderating role of individualism and uncertainty avoidance on cross-functional coopetition. Organizational cultural dimensions directly enhance cross-functional coopetition. Furthermore, strong social values of individualism and uncertainty avoidance weaken the relationship between organizational culture and cross-functional coopetition. This study provides a novel perspective on how organizational culture can represent a strategic resource by illuminating the cultural mechanisms that influence coopetition within the firm. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-functional coopetition; Individualism; Organizational culture; Uncertainty avoidance","","Ailon G., Mirror, mirror on the wall: culture's consequences in a value test of its own design, Acad.

This research explores the relatively understudied influence of culture on individuals’ susceptibility to concepts derived from behavioral economics. Employing the Individual Cultural Values Scale (CVSCALE), we examine the impact of culture on the allure of choice, mental accounting, and overconfidence among 837 participants from Australia (AU), China (CN), Germany (GE), and the United States (US) through logistic regression analysis. At the individual level, discernible interactions between power–distance, allure of choice, and overconfidence are observed. On the national scale, power–distance (AU, US), uncertainty avoidance (US), and masculinity (CN) significantly impact the allure of choice, while overconfidence is influenced by power–distance (US) and masculinity (US). Our analysis shows that culture plays a pivotal role in shaping susceptibility to biases and heuristics, thereby influencing decision-making processes. The findings advocate for a culturally differentiated approach to behavioral economics, emphasizing the need to tailor strategies and interventions based on cultural nuances. © 2024 by the authors.","behavioral economics; behavioral finance; culture; decision making; lure of choice; mental accounting; overconfidence","","Daniel K., Tversky A., Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk, Econometrica, 47, pp. 263-292, (1979); Don A.M., Overprecision Is a Property of Thinking Systems, Psychol.

This paper deals with the concept of ambidextrous routines in knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Specifically, drawing on a sample of 1468 MNEs from 24 regions in China, we find that a synergetic combination of explorative and exploitative virtual knowledge is positively associated with MNE performance. In contrast, an imbalance between explorative and exploitative virtual knowledge hurts MNE performance. Furthermore, the effect of imbalanced ambidexterity in virtual knowledge sharing is moderated by the cultural distance in the uncertainty avoidance between the R&D team and the region where the team operates. This paper elaborates on the characteristics of ambidextrous KM initiatives at the micro-level; firms use ambidextrous KM practices to create a learning context, defined by guidelines and methods rather than by a definite purpose. The clear separation of KM initiatives’ purpose and their embedded learning routines and methods enables them to be used ambidextrously. Furthermore, this analysis indicates that ambidextrous KM initiatives follow a path characterized by an increasing variety of purposes but a decreasing variety of underlying structures. Consequently, firms create a learning context that can be activated when necessary in ways required in an exploratory and/or in an exploitative mode. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ambidextrous virtual knowledge sharing within R&D teams; International human resource management; International R&D teams; Organization–environment cultural fit; Uncertainty avoidance","","Adair W., Xiong T.X., How Chinese and Caucasian Canadians conceptualize creativity: The moderating role of uncertainty avoidance, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 49, 2, pp. 223-238, (2018); Amabile T.M., A model of creativity and innovation in organizations, Research in organizational behavior, pp. 123-167, (1988); Amabile T.M., Creativity in context, (1996); Amabile T.M., Conti R., Coon H., Lazenby J., Herron M., Assessing the work environment for creativity, Academy of Management Journal, 39, 5, pp. 1154-1184, (1996); Andrews F.M., Construct validity and error components of survey measures, Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 2, pp. 409-442, (1984); Andriopoulos C., Lewis M.W., Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational ambidexterity: Managing paradoxes of innovation, Organization Science, 20, 4, pp. 696-717, (2009); Argyres N., Capabilities, technological diversification and divisionalization, Strategic Management Journal, 17, 5, pp. 395-410, (1996); Au K., Another consequence of culture–intra-cultural variation, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 8, 5, pp. 743-756, (1992); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Process management and technological innovation: A longitudinal study of the photography and paint industries, Administrative Science Quarterly, 47, 4, pp. 676-706, (2002); Benner M.J., Tushman M.L., Exploitation, exploration, and process management: The productivity dilemma revisited, Academy of Management Review, 28, 2, pp. 238-256, (2003); Beugelsdijk S., Kostova T., Kunst V.E., Spadafora E., van Essen M., Cultural distance and firm internationalization: A meta-analytical review and theoretical implications, Journal of Management, 44, 1, pp. 89-130, (2018); Beugelsdijk S., Maseland R., Van Hoorn A., Are scores on Hofstede’s dimensions of national culture stable over time?

Conducted across various European countries from May to July 2023, this study, with a final dataset of 145 responses, ventures beyond traditional technology acceptance models. By integrating Hofstede's cultural dimensions with the perceived usefulness construct from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we explore their collective impact on cloud service utilization in the workplace. Employing a robust survey methodology and ordinal logistic regression analysis, this research reveals nuanced insights into how individualism and uncertainty avoidance influence cloud adoption, with perceived usefulness acting as a pivotal moderator. The findings not only extend the theoretical discourse on technology acceptance by highlighting the intricate role of cultural factors but also offer practical guidance for crafting IT strategies that align with individual cultural values. Contributing to the scholarly conversation on digital transformation within organizational contexts, this paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving cloud service utilization among employees. Its implications resonate across the academic and practical realms, underscoring the significance of cultural awareness in the successful implementation of cloud technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud computing utilization; Individualism; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance model; Uncertainty avoidance","Distributed database systems; Uncertainty analysis; Cloud computing utilization; Cloud services; Cloud-computing; Cultural influences; Individualism; Organizational cultures; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Uncertainty avoidance; computer system; culture; regression analysis; technology adoption; uncertainty analysis; workplace; Cloud computing","Wang W.T., Chang C.F., The adoption of cloud computing services: the moderating effect of organizational culture, 20th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, PACIS 2016.

Hofstede´s cultural dimensions have been widely studied in different contexts. Dorfman and Howell designed an instrument in English to measure those dimensions. However, there is no validated Spanish version for this instrument. The objective of this article is to provide to the Ibero-American community a Spanish version of the Dorfman and Howell instrument. The questionnaire was translated into Spanish and adapted to the Chilean and Colombian populations. The study included 1136 participants, 500 from Chile and 636 from Colombia. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were supported by the KMO and the Bartlett tests. Results indicate a better fit of a five-factor model, in similarity with the English language original instrument, as follows: masculinity–femininity, paternalism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism–collectivism. Construct validity of the scales was confirmed in the Chilean sample, showing results consistent with previous meta-analytical research. The Dorfman and Howell instrument is a valid questionnaire for the evaluation of cultural dimensions in Spanish-speaking populations. The measurement of culture is a tool that leaders have available to facilitate the understanding and management of people. Organizations with operations in different countries or with intercultural context may use the results of this instrument to tune up their interventions. © 2022 by the authors.

While knowledge and best practices become moving targets, the modern-organizations have swiftly moved to psychological safety culture that fosters growth, innovation and individual learning. In context, transformational leadership fosters innovative behaviors and learning abilities, successful organizational transformations and effective actions for performance beyond expectations. Hence, the study aims is to examine the impact of transformational leadership on individual learning behavior, under mediating conditions of psychological safety and moderating influence of uncertainty avoidance. Using partial least squares (PLS) based structural equation modeling (SEM) and survey of 350 telecom-employees, the results reveal that transformational leadership and individual learning behavior relationship is partially mediated by psychological safety. Alternatively, uncertainty avoidance reveals an insignificant role as a moderator. Our findings generate managerial implications for advancing individual learning cultures and guiding continuous improvements in diverse work settings. In line with the theoretical base of ""too much of a good thing (TMGT) effect"", our study highlights potential avenues for future research to explore the dark side of psychological safety and its counter-productive effect on workplace behaviors. © 2020 Johar Education Society Pakistan.","Individual learning behavior;

Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative approach, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions are probed to appreciate the extent to which the cultures of Japan, The Netherlands and Saudi Arabia are different. Thereafter, the national open data portals of the three countries are analyzed in terms of their nature and scope to underline the extent to which there is a match between the cultural characteristics and the extent of commitment and implementation of open data initiative. Findings: There are cultural dissimilarities across the three countries and the same is reflected in the extent of commitment toward open data initiatives. Saudi Arabia, with its “collectivist” and high “power distance” score, is more reserved in implementing its open data initiative as compared with Japan or The Netherlands. Similarly, The Netherlands, which scores high in terms of “feminity” and “long-term orientation,” is more forthcoming in publishing data sets, with many government organizations taking up the initiative of publishing the data sets. Finally, with more degree of “uncertainty avoidance,” Saudi Arabia prefers to remain on the safe side by publishing only those data sets that are non-controversial, insensitive and readily available. At the same time, the open data initiatives across the three countries require the adoption of a more rigorous and committed approach to ensure that the goals of transparency and public accountability are better met and there is more reuse of the data sets by improvising the user-friendliness of the interfaces for tapping them. Research limitations/implications: Taking examples from three countries, representative of the different cultural characteristics, it is desirable that further research be conducted by including more countries and deriving an evaluation framework for analyzing the sustainability of the open data initiatives in terms of their culture. Practical implications: Governments are encouraged to adopt a more committed stance toward institutionalizing the open data initiatives and policymakers should ensure that the quality of data sets is sustained for maximum reuse of the data sets and for the derivation of public value. Social implications: Citizens should engage themselves in tapping the data sets for improvising them and contribute toward the existing data sets as well. Originality/value: Hitherto, there has been focus on the examples of open data initiatives across different countries, but the role of culture was never investigated while analyzing the open data initiatives. This is the first study where the countries’ open data initiatives are probed in terms of the cultural variations across the three countries using the cultural dimensions identified by Hofstede. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Japan; Open data; Saudi Arabia; The Netherlands","","Adu K.K., Dube L., Adjei E., Digital preservation: the conduit through which open data, electronic government and the right to information are implemented, Library Hi Tech, 34, 4, pp. 733-747, (2016); Afful-Dadzie E., Afful-Dadzie A., Open government data in Africa: a preference elicitation analysis of media practitioners, Government Information Quarterly, (2017); Alexopoulos C., Zuiderwijk A., Charalabidis Y., Loukis E., Janssen M., Designing a second generation of open data platforms: integrating open data and social media.

To deter employees from deviant behavior, organizations often implement sanction mechanisms. However, evidence from research regarding the efficiency of such a deterrence approach has been mixed. Drawing on this inconsistency, this paper examines the applicability of deterrence theory in information security policy compliance research. It is argued that contextual and methodological moderators play a crucial role when conceptualizing deterrence theory in security studies. Applying a meta-analysis, the results suggest that sanctions have an overall effect on deviant behavior. However, the results also indicate that this relationship is dependent on the study’s context. Deterrence theory better predicts deviant behavior in malicious contexts, cultures with a high degree of power distance, and cultures with a high uncertainty avoidance. The meta-analysis also reveals no meaningful differences arising from the methodological context in terms of scenario-based and behavior-specific measurement. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Compliance behavior; Deterrence theory; Information security policy; Meta-analysis","Security systems; Compliance behavior; Deterrence theory; Information security policies; Meta analysis; Power distances; Sanction mechanisms; Security studies; Uncertainty avoidance; Security of data","Alshare K., Lane P.L., Lane M.R., Information security policy compliance: A higher education case study, Information and Computer Security, 26, 1, pp. 91-108, (2018); Arunothong W., Three Research Essays on Propensity to Disclose Medical Information through Formal and Social Information Technologies, (2014); Aurigemma S., Mattson T., Deterrence and punishment experience impacts on ISP compliance attitudes, Information & Computer Security, 25, 4, pp. 421-436, (2017); Baskerville R., Siponen M., An information security meta-policy for emergent organizations, Logistics Information Management, 15, 5-6, pp. 337-346, (2002); Bochner S., Hesketh B., Power distance, individualism/collectivism, and job-related attitudes in a culturally diverse work group, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 25, 2, pp. 233-257, (1994); Brown D.A., Examining the Behavioral Intention of individuals’ Compliance with Information Security Policies.

However, we still have an incomplete understanding of why the strength of this relationship varies across contexts. In this study, we leverage implicit leadership theory to explain why cross-national differences in cultural values moderate this relationship. First, drawing on implicit leadership theory, we develop theory-based predictions about why the cultural value dimensions from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) study explain differences in the strength of this relationship across countries. Then, we aggregate findings from 51 primary studies (k = 51, N = 16,870) conducted across 12 countries to test our hypotheses. Our results indicate that the negative relationship between destructive leadership and job satisfaction weakens in magnitude as uncertainty avoidance, future orientation, power distance, and assertiveness values increase. Conversely, the negative relationship between destructive leadership and job satisfaction strengthens in magnitude as institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, humane orientation, performance orientation, and gender egalitarianism values increase. We also demonstrate the independent, relative, and collective predictive validity of GLOBE’s cultural values as moderators of the relationship between destructive leadership and followers’ job satisfaction. Collectively, our findings (1) indicate that cross-national differences exist in the relationship between destructive leadership and followers’ job satisfaction and (2) highlight the need to consider destructive leadership in light of the broader cultural context in which it is being examined. © The Author(s) 2024.","culture; global leadership and organizational behavior effectiveness; job satisfaction; leadership; meta-analysis","","Aguinis H., Dalton D.R., Bosco F.A., Pierce C.A., Dalton C.M., Meta-analytic choices and judgment calls: Implications for theory building and testing, obtained effect sizes, and scholarly impact, Journal of Management, 37, 1, pp. 5-38, (2011); Aguinis H., Gottfredson R.K., Joo H., Best-practice recommendations for defining, identifying, and handling outliers, Organizational Research Methods, 16, 2, pp. 270-301, (2013); Aguinis H., Ramani R.S., Cascio W.F., Methodological practices in international business research: An after-action review of challenges and solutions, Journal of International Business Studies, 51, pp. 1593-1608, (2020); Andersson L.M., Pearson C.M., Tit for tat?

We aim to examine the interconnection between these elements and conduct an in-depth theoretical research paper focusing on these elements and the different variables related to them. The study deeply examines the theoretical literature associated with various definitions of culture and its correlation with leadership, and comes up finally with results and recommendations. The researchers are also examining whether the nature of the relationship can be determined by market conditions, like the level of competition and the organisational age and scale. Market competition appears to affect the direction of the relationship, with the corresponding impact of operational age and size. Such findings show that both organisational factors contribute significantly, while the alignment of factors (identical cultural type and leadership style) improves this connection. Such observations refer to the work of Hofstede (1980), the most commonly quoted work on the subject (Bond, 2002). Hofstede used the five-dimension method (power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, avoidance of confusion, long-term orientation) for the development of national-cultural profiles. Since no significant market changes took place over the last five years (in terms of reform or privatisation), leadership and culture are most likely associated with a transparent system.

Building on this finding, the present study examines how the amount of institutional and value support for cultural pluralism in a society is related to its climate and level of innovation performance. Cultural pluralism is defined as the societal condition in which minority groups within a society can maintain their distinctive cultural identities, values, and practices provided that they are consistent with the laws and values of the wider society. Institutions and values that support cultural pluralism include political democracy, tolerance for uncertainty, prioritization of secular-rational values, and openness to foreign cultures. I hypothesize that institutional and value support for cultural pluralism is stronger in societies with more challenging climate and higher innovation performance. I tested this hypothesis using society-level measures of harshness of climatic condition and innovation performance as predictors. The results showed that in societies with demanding climate and high innovation performance, their citizens tend to support democracy, are more tolerant of uncertainty, prioritize secular-rational values, and take more leisure trips outside of their home country. These results illustrate that innovation, through its moderation effect on climate, predicts the amount of institutional and value support for cultural pluralism, highlighting the reciprocal effects of culture and innovation. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","country-level; creativity; cross-cultural; cultural pluralism; cultural psychology; democracy; innovation; uncertainty avoidance","article; avoidance behavior; climate; creativity; cultural diversity; cultural psychology; democracy; human; identity; minority group; organization; uncertainty","Amabile T., Creativity in context, (1996); Arrow K., Bolin B., Costanza R., Dasgupta P., Folke C., Holling C.S., Pimentel D., Economic growth, carrying capacity, and the environment, Ecological Economics, 15, pp. 91-95, (1995); Arrow K., Dasgupta P., Goulder L., Daily G., Ehrlich P., Heal G., Walker B., Are we consuming too much?, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 18, pp. 147-172, (2004); Ayres R.U., Sustainability economics: Where do we stand?, Ecological Economics, 67, pp. 281-310, (2008); Beise-Zee M., Rennings K., Lead markets and regulation: A framework for analyzing the international diffusion of environmental innovation, Ecological Economics, 52, pp. 5-17, (2005); Boons F., Wagner M., Assessing the relationship between economic and ecological performance: Distinguishing system levels and the role of innovation, Ecological Economics, 68, pp. 1908-1914, (2009); Chen J., Chiu C.Y., Chan S.F., The cultural effects of job mobility and the belief in a fixed world: Evidence from performance forecast, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, pp. 851-865, (2009); Chiu C., Chen J., Symbols and interactions: Application of the CCC model to culture, language, and social identity, Language matters: Communication, culture, and social identity, pp. 155-182, (2004); Chiu C.Y., Kwan L.Y.Y., Culture and creativity: A process model, Management and Organization Review, 63, pp. 447-461, (2010); Connolly W., The ethos of pluralization, (1995); The Global innovation index 2013: The local dynamics of innovation, (2013); Survey, (2013); Galambos L., Global perspectives on modern business, Business History Review, 71, pp. 287-290, (1997); Georgas J., van de D., Vijver F.J., Berry J.W., The ecocultural framework, ecosocial indices, and psychological variables in cross-cultural research, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, pp. 74-96, (2004); Hazard W.R., Stent M., Cultural pluralism and schooling: Some preliminary observations, Cultural pluralism in education: A mandate for change, pp. 13-25, (1973); Hofstede G.H., Culture’s consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions and organizations across nations, (2001); Hong Y.Y., Chiu C.Y., Toward a paradigm shift: From cross-cultural differences in social cognition to social-cognitive mediation of cultural differences, Social Cognition, 19, pp. 181-196, (2001); Inglehart R., Baker W.E., Modernization, cultural change, and the persistence of traditional values, American Sociological Review, 65, pp. 19-51, (2000); Inglehart R., Oyserman D., Individualism, autonomy, self-expression and human development, Comparing cultures: Dimensions of culture in a comparative perspective, pp. 74-96, (2004); Kashima Y., Conceptions of culture and person for psychology, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 31, pp. 14-32, (2000); Kwan L.Y.Y., Chiu C.Y., Country variations in different innovation outputs: The interactive effect of institutional support and human capital, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 36, pp. 1050-1070, (2015); Mahbubani K., Can Asians think?

Therefore, the concepts of person-organization fit and person-job fit can also be affected by the managers' culture. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to examine the relationships between organization, job fit and cultural values of nurse managers working in university hospitals in Turkey. METHODS: This research is a cross-sectional analytical study. The research sample comprised 391 nurse managers working in the 20 university hospitals in Turkey. The research data were collected via an information form, individual cultural values scale, person-organization fit scale (POFS), and person-job fit scale (PJFS). Descriptive statistics were computed to define demographic characteristics. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between numeric variables. RESULTS: The means of the nurse managers' power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, masculinity, long-term orientation scores were 3.03, 5.98, 5.34, 3.02, and 5.60, respectively. The means of the nurse managers' POFS and PJFS scores were 3.33 and 4.13, respectively. There was a positive relationship among power distance and long-term orientation dimensions and person-organization fit, while there was a negative relationship between the masculinity dimension and person-job fit (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the nurse managers' individual cultural values were related to the organization and job fit. In this context, it is worth considering the individuals' cultural values in nurse recruitment and selection processes.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

This study assumes even more significance when taking into account the countries nationalistic culture, which has a high power distance index and high uncertainty avoidance index as per the Hofstede Cultural Dimensions Index. Change management initiative is expensive in nature more so, in a pluralistic environment with multiple cultures as the case of the organization under study. The challenge becomes even more difficult if the change is targeted at the existing cultures in the organization. As the authors were part of the change management initiative, the various stages adopted in moving the organization culture from entitlement to performance are analyzed in detail. The use of common narratives and unified performance appraisal methodology, leadership engagement and Normalization process lead to a demonstrated change in the performance appraisal rating for the targeted group of employees. The impact of the common narratives, lead to a decrease in the rating of exceeding and above categories for managers and above by almost 50 %.What it effectively highlights is that the journey to build a performance driven culture is ongoing and it's through the common narratives and understanding that the desired outcomes can be achieved. Such a large scale study on the impact of building a new performance culture has not been done in the Middle East before. The learnings would be of immense value to organizations wanting to incorporate such changes in the future. In addition, limited papers have adopted the action research method to observe culture creation phenomena in spite of it offering clear insights due to the involvement of the authors in the culture creation. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.","","Gasoline; Cultural dimensions; Employee performance; Normalization process; Organization culture; Performance appraisal; Performance appraisal system; Performance cultures; Uncertainty avoidance; Personnel","Alteneiji E.A., Leadership Cultural Values of United Arab Emirates-The Case of United Arab Emirates, (2015); Araujo L., Easton G., Networks in socioeconomic systems: A critical review, Networks in Marketing, pp. 63-107; Awasthi V.N., Chow C.W., Wu A., Cross-cultural differences in the behavioral consequences of imposing performance evaluation and reward systems: An experimental investigation, The International Journal of Accounting, 36, 3, pp. 291-309, (2001); Ayers R.S., Aligning individual and organizational performance, Public Personnel Management, 44, 2, pp. 169-191, (2015); Bergold J., Thomas S., Participatory research methods: A methodological approach in motion, Historical Social Research/Historische Sozialforschung, pp. 191-222, (2012); Biscardini G., Morrison R., Branson D., Del Maestro A., 2017 Oil and Gas Trends - Adjusting Business Models to a Period of Recovery Contacts, (2017); Bititci U.S., Mendibil K., Nudurupati S., Garengo P., Turner T., Dynamics of performance measurement and organisational culture, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 26, 12, pp. 1325-1350, (2006); Borges R.S.G., Organizational change implementation and the role of human resource practices: A brazilian case study, EnANPAD, 6, 3, pp. 1-12, (2009); Cappelli B.Y.P., Tavis A., The performance management revolution, Harvard Business Review, (2016); Pollitt C., Beyond the managerial model: The case for broadening performance assessment in government and the public services, Financial Accountability & Management, 2, 3, (1986); Coghlan D., Brannick T., Doing Action in your Own Second Edition (Second), (2005); De Waal A.A., Performance-driven behavior as the key to improved organizational performance, Measuring Business Excellence, 14, 1, pp. 79-95, (2010); De Waal A., Chipeta K., Influence of culture on priority-setting of high performance activities, Journal of Strategy and Management, 8, 1, pp. 64-86, (2015); Dunford R., Jones D., Narrative in strategic change, Human Relations, 59, 9, pp. 1207-1226, (2000); Eisenhardt K.M., Control: Organizational and economic approaches, Management Science, 31, 2, pp. 134-149, (1985); Ellington J.K., Wilson M.A., The performance appraisal milieu: A multilevel analysis of context effects in performance ratings, Journal of Business and Psychology, 32, 1, pp. 87-100, (2017); Frederickson D.G., Frederickson H.G., Measuring the Performance of the Hollow State, (2006); Goodson I., Walker R., Biography, Identity, and Schooling: Episodes in Educational Research, (1991); Greenwood D., Levin M., Participatory evaluation, Introduction to Action Research: Social Research for Social Change, pp. 184-193, (1998); Hofstede G.H., Culture-s consequences: International differences in work-related values, Cross-Cultural Research and Methodology Series, 41, (1980); Hofstetter H., Harpaz I., Declared versus actual organizational culture as indicated by an organization- s performance appraisal, The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 26, 4, pp. 445-466, (2015); Johns G., The essential impact of context on organizational behavior, Academy of Management Review, 31, 2, pp. 386-408, (2006); Khaitan R., IPOs of These 4 GCC Oil and Gas Companies are Much Anticipated, with More to Come, (2017); Kim S., Lee J., Yu K., Corporate culture and organizational performance, Journal of Managerial Psychology Journal of Managerial Psychology Iss Leadership &Amp Organization Development Journal, 19, 1, pp. 340-359, (2004); Lawton M.P., Moss M., Kleban M.H., Glicksman A., Rovine M., A two-factor model of caregiving appraisal and psychological well-being, Journal of Gerontology, 46, 4, pp. 181-189, (1991); Ledford G.E., Benson G., Lawler E.E., Aligning research and the current practice of performance management, Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 9, 2, pp. 253-260, (2016); Linna A., Elovainio M., Van Den Bos K., Kivimki M., Pentti J., Vahtera J., Can usefulness of performance appraisal interviews change organizational justice perceptions?

Design/methodology/approach: A meta-analysis using data from 82 independent studies was conducted to explore the hypothesized relationships and verify how they were contingent on uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation. Findings: The results supported the majority of hypotheses about the relationships between antecedents and creativity. Furthermore, they showed that the effects of intrinsic motivation, positive affect and climate for innovation on creativity in the hospitality and tourism industries were significantly larger than those reported in previous meta-analyses. It also showed that uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation could buffer or strengthen some associations. Practical implications: This study generates some essential managerial suggestions for organizations in need of innovation. Managers can learn from the results so as to effectively promote the ability, motivation and opportunity for creativity and merge cultural elements with innovation strategy when they operate globally. Originality/value: This study provides a theory-based explanation for how employee creativity can be activated. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is a first attempt to meta-analytically test the underlying determinants of employee creativity in the hospitality and tourism industries. Additionally, the search for boundary conditions of the proposed relationships is likely to reconcile existing conflicts and inspire future studies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Antecedents; Creativity; Long-term orientation; Meta-analysis; Uncertainty avoidance","","Amabile T.M., A model of creativity and innovation in organizations, Research in Organizational Behavior, pp. 123-167, (1988); Baas M., De Dreu C.K., Nijstad B.A., When prevention promotes creativity: the role of mood, regulatory focus, and regulatory closure, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100, 5, pp. 794-809, (2011); Bandura A., Social cognitive theory: an agentic perspective, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, 1, pp. 1-26, (2001); Bani-Melhem S., Zeffane R., Albaity M., Determinants of employees’ innovative behavior, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 30, 3, pp. 1601-1620, (2018); Bartlett F.C., Thinking, (1958); Bass B.M., Two decades of research and development in transformational leadership, European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 8, 1, pp. 9-32, (1999); Baumeister R.F., Leary M.R., The need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, Psychological Bulletin, 117, 3, pp. 497-529, (1995); Bearden W., Money R.B., Nevins J.L., A measure of long-term orientation: development and validation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 34, 3, pp. 456-467, (2006); Brockner J., Higgins E.T., Regulatory focus theory: implications for the study of emotions at work, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 86, 1, pp. 35-66, (2001); Broshi-Chen O., Mansfeld Y., A wasted invitation to innovate?

Although KS is informed by culture, the external validity of the empirical results of most of the research investigating the influence of culture, defined and operationalised at the macro (national or organisational) level, on KS is problematic since the cultural orientation of individuals in a particular society or organisation may not be homogeneous. This study adopted a Theory of Reasoned Action-based model to analyze the influence of espoused individualism-collectivism (IC), espoused uncertainty avoidance (UCA), social norm (SN), and attitude (ATT) on academics' KS intentions and behaviours. The results are derived using a data set from a large public Arabian University. SN, ATT, and intention positively influence KS behaviour. Collectivism positively influences SN, ATT, intention, and behaviour. Unexpectedly, uncertainty tolerance positively influences ATT and intention. These results provide significant statistical support for the explanatory power of the model. They also put forward empirically based evidence that adds much-needed nuance to the current discourse on KS intention and behaviour and informs policies and strategies that enhance KS in the academe. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Co.","academe; individualism-collectivism; intention; Knowledge sharing; social norm; Theory of Reasoned Action; uncertainty avoidance","Uncertainty analysis; Cultural orientation; Explanatory power; External validities; Individualism collectivisms; Knowledge-sharing; Organisational; Theory of reasoned action; Uncertainty avoidance; Knowledge management","Ajzen I, From Intentions to actions: A theory of planned behaviour, Action Control: From Cognitions to Behavior, pp. 11-39, (1985); Ajzen I, The theory of planned behavior: Some unresolved issues, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I, Constructing a TPB questionnaire: Conceptual and Methodological Considerations, (2006); Ajzen I, Fishbein M, Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behaviour, (1980); Ali AJ, Taqi AA, Krishnan K, Individualism, collectivism, and decision styles of managers in Kuwait, The Journal of Social Psychology, 137, 5, pp. 629-637, (1997); Al-Kurdi O, El-Haddadeh R, Eldabi T, Knowledge sharing in higher education institutions: A systematic review, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 31, 2, pp. 226-246, (2018); Anderson J, Gerbing D, Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423, (1988); Andrews KM, Delahaye BL, Influences on knowledge processes in organizational learning: The psychological filter, Journal of Management Studies, 37, 6, pp. 2322-2380, (2000); Armstrong RW, The relationship between culture and perception of ethical problems in international Marketing, Journal of Business Ethics, 15, 11, pp. 1199-1208, (1996); Bagozzi RP, Yi Y, Phillips LW, Assessing construct validity in organizational research, Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 3, pp. 421-458, (1991); Bartol KM, Srivastava A, Encouraging knowledge sharing: The role of organizational reward systems, Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, 9, 1, pp. 64-76, (2002); Bock GW, Zmud RW, Kim YG, Lee JN, Behavioral intention formation in knowledge sharing: Examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate, MIS Quarterly, 29, 1, pp. 87-112, (2005); Cabrera EF, Cabrera A, Fostering knowledge sharing through people management practices, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 16, pp. 720-735, (2005); Carter C, Scarbrough H, Towards a second generation of KM?

The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and GLOBE project were used as data sources. Cultural values, regional affiliation, and economic development levels were used to cluster the selected countries. Correlations between values and operating SEA were checked for the entire sample, as well as for each of the three clusters. A positive correlation between ‘Gender Egalitarianism’ and narrowly defined operating SEA and negative correlation between ‘Uncertainty Avoidance’ and the aforementioned SEA was confirmed for all the countries, while the linkage between ‘Future Orientation’, ‘In-group Collectivism’, and operating SEA was partially verified. Research results suggest that culture is not sufficient to justify national differences in SE rates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Culture; GEM; GLOBE; Social Entrepreneurship","","Achtenhagen L., Welter F., Female entrepreneurship in Germany, New Perspectives on Women Entrepreneurs, pp. 71-100, (2003); Alvord S.H., Brown L.D., Letts C.W., Social entrepreneurship and societal transformation an exploratory study, The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 40, 3, pp. 260-282, (2004); Alter K., (2019); Anderson A., Li J., Entrepreneurship and networked collaboration; synergetic innovation, knowledge and uncertainty, Journal of General Management, 40, 1, pp. 7-21, (2014); Ashkanasy N.M., Gupta V., Mayfield M.S., Trevor-Roberts E., Future orientation, Culture, leadership, and organizations.

This paper examines how four factors (country of origin and the espoused national cultures of masculinity, collectivism and uncertainty avoidance) influence the level of responsibility toward three stakeholders at different levels of hierarchy in an organization. Design/methodology/approach: Using a case-based approach, this study collects data from 432 accounting students from two different countries. Using regression analysis on the pooled data, this paper provides evidence on how accounting students would behave when facing a whistleblowing situation involving their immediate supervisor. Findings: This study finds that country of origin and espoused national cultural values influence the individual’s decision regarding whom to blow the whistle. Originality/value: The study has improved upon the methodological deficiencies of previous studies that rely on Hofstede’s (1980) cultural values in that the paper focuses on the espoused national culture at the individual level. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture;

While research has found significant cross-country differences in organizations’ spending on professional services, we do not know why they occur. Inspired by the organizational buying behavior literature, this paper investigates the influence of national culture on the use of professional services, particularly management consulting services. As the use of professional services involves considerable uncertainties—particularly for the buyer—it can be assumed to be influenced by cultural differences regarding the level of Uncertainty Avoidance, Individualism and Masculinity. By drawing on two independent cross-country studies, we show that organizations in high uncertainty avoidance and individualistic cultures use professional services less than organizations in low uncertainty avoidance and collectivist cultures. We found no relationship between Hofstede's dimension of Masculinity and the use of professional services. The findings contribute to the theorizing on how the cultural context influences organizational buying behavior and the purchasing of professional services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consulting service purchasing; Individualism; National culture; Professional services; Service consumption; Uncertainty avoidance","","Aarikka-Stenroos L., Jaakkola E., Value co-creation in knowledge intensive business services: a dyadic perspective on the joint problem solving process, Ind.

This paper examines whether culture and patriotism influence home bias in bond portfolios. In this respect, I differentiate between two different aspects of home bias: domestic bias (overinvestment in domestic debt securities) and foreign bias (over- or underinvestment in debt securities issued by different host countries). The analysis uses the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey data over the 2004–2012 period and relies on extensive robustness checks based on four internationally recognized cross-cultural research projects: the GLOBE study of House et al. (Culture, leadership, and organizations: the GLOBE study of 62 societies, Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, 2004), the “Cultures and Organizations” of Hofstede et al. (Cultures and organizations: software of the mind, 3rd edn, McGraw-Hill, New York, 2010), the International Social Survey Program, and the World Values Survey. There is strong evidence that patriotism deters foreign investment and increases overinvestment in domestic bonds. Investors from countries with higher levels of uncertainty avoidance invest less in foreign debt markets. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bonds; Culture; Home bias; International diversification; Patriotism","","Aggarwal R., Goodell J.W., Markets and institutions in financial intermediation: national characteristics as determinants, J Bank Financ, 33, pp. 1770-1780, (2009); Aggarwal R., Kearney C., Lucey B., Gravity and culture in foreign portfolio investment, J Bank Financ, 36, pp. 525-538, (2012); Anderson C.W., Fedenia M., Hirschey M., Skiba H., Cultural influences on home bias and international diversification by institutional investors, J Bank Financ, 35, pp. 916-934, (2011); Benartzi S., Excessive extrapolation and the allocation of 401(k) accounts to company stock, J Financ, 56, pp. 1747-1764, (2001); Benos E., Jochec M., Patriotic name bias and stock returns, J Financ Mark, 16, pp. 550-570, (2013); Beugelsdijk S., Frijns B., A cultural explanation of the foreign bias in international asset allocation, J Bank Financ, 34, pp. 2121-2131, (2010); Boyle P., Garlappi L., Uppal R., Wang T., Keynes meets Markowitz: the trade-off between familiarity and diversification, Manag Sci, 58, pp. 253-272, (2012); Chan K., Covrig V., Ng L., What determines the domestic bias and foreign bias?

Cox Blvd., 324N Powers Hall, Clemson, 29634, SC, United States","Many consumer goods multinational companies (MNCs) operate host-market subsidiaries that are responsible for managing relationships with local retailers. These retailers often follow a decentralized approach by formally involving their store managers in key decision-making processes related to the MNCs’ brands. While store managers play a key role in the success of MNCs’ brands, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) what drives a store manager’s psychological engagement with MNCs’ brands across cultures, and (2) do cultural differences matter to translating store managers’ psychological brand engagement into constructive brand voice behavior? We answer these questions using a multilevel dataset spanning nine Latin American countries/MNC subsidiaries, five data sources, and three time periods. The findings reveal that uncertainty avoidance exerts a differing moderating influence on the relationship of MNC–retailer relationship investment and the store managers' MNC brand knowledge with psychological brand engagement, whereas individualism and uncertainty avoidance positively moderate the effect of MNC’s extra-contractual incentives on store managers' psychological brand engagement. Also, psychological brand engagement takes on a more important role in leading store managers to speak up, at lower levels of long-term orientation. Finally, we show that inducing store managers to engage in constructive brand voice behavior increases time-lagged, objective data on MNC’s salesperson performance. © 2022, Academy of International Business.","brand engagement; buyer–seller; culture; MNCs; multilevel analysis; retail store managers","","Aguinis H., Gottfredson R.K., Culpepper S.A., Best-practice recommendations for estimating cross-level interaction effects using multilevel modeling, Journal of Management, 39, 6, pp. 1490-1528, (2013); Ahearne M., Jelinek R., Jones E., Examining the effect of salesperson service behavior in a competitive context, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 35, 4, pp. 603-616, (2007); Alon I., Jaffe E., Global marketing, (2013); Anderson E., Weitz B., The use of pledges to build and sustain commitment in distribution channels, Journal of Marketing Research, 29, 1, pp. 18-34, (1992); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Bayesian analysis using Mplus: Technical implementation., (2010); Asparouhov T., Muthen B., Multiple-group factor analysis alignment, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 21, 4, pp. 495-508, (2014); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Beck J.T., Chapman K., Palmatier R.W., Understanding relationship marketing and loyalty program effectiveness in global markets, Journal of International Marketing, 23, 3, pp. 1-21, (2015); Bell D.E., Lal R., Salmon W.J., Globalization of retailing, The global market: Developing a strategy to manage across borders, pp. 288-312, (2004); Birnik A., Bowman C., Marketing mix standardization in multinational corporations: A review of the evidence, International Journal of Management Reviews, 9, 4, pp. 303-324, (2007); Bolton R.N., A dynamic model of the duration of the customer's relationship with a continuous service provider: The role of satisfaction, Marketing Science, 17, 1, pp. 45-65, (1998); Brodie R.J., Hollebeek L.D., Juric B., Ilic A., Customer engagement: Conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, Journal of Service Research, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Chabowski B.R., Samiee S., Hult G.T.M., Cross-national research and international business: An interdisciplinary path, International Business Review, 26, 1, pp. 89-101, (2017); Chang M.H., Harrington J.E., Centralization vs. decentralization in a multi-unit organization: A computational model of a retail chain as a multi-agent adaptive system, Management Science, 46, 11, pp. 1427-1440, (2000); Chelminski P., Coulter R.A., The effects of cultural individualism and self-confidence on propensity to voice: From theory to measurement to practice, Journal of International Marketing, 15, 4, pp. 94-118, (2007); Chung H., Beretvas S.N., The impact of ignoring multiple membership data structures in multilevel models, British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 65, 2, pp. 185-200, (2012); Cuervo-Cazurra A., Anderson U., Brannen M.Y., Nielsen B.B., Reuber A.R., From the editors: Can I trust your findings?

In the following days, media reports showed that consumers increasingly stockpiled groceries and household supplies. Interestingly, behavioral data show that this stockpiling exhibited considerable heterogeneity across countries. Building on cultural dimension theory, the authors theorize that this heterogeneity can be explained by countries’ cultural values: consumer stockpiling after the World Health Organization's announcement was more pronounced in countries whose residents show high uncertainty avoidance, low long-term orientation, low indulgence, and high individualism. The authors confirm these propositions using global mobility data from Google matched with country-level data on cultural values, pandemic reaction policies, and other key variables. This research note thereby integrates the previously disconnected literature on cultural dimension theory and consumer stockpiling in general, as well as provides new and significant knowledge about cross-cultural consumer behavior in crises. Furthermore, the authors provide actionable insights for international policy makers and business managers who aim to predict or control consumer stockpiling in future global crises to enhance consumer well-being. © The Author(s) 2021.","coronavirus; COVID-19; culture; Hofstede; pandemic; stockpiling","","Ashraf B.N., Stock Markets’ Reaction to Covid-19: Moderating Role of National Culture, Finance Research Letters, (2020); Bahadir B., Bahadir S.C., Financial Development and Country-Level Advertising Spending: The Moderating Role of Economic Development and National Culture, Journal of International Marketing, 28, 3, pp. 3-20, (2020); Baker S.M., Hill R.P., A Community Psychology of Object Meanings: Identity Negotiation During Disaster Recovery, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 23, 3, pp. 275-287, (2013); Baker S.M., Hunt D.M., Rittenburg T.L., Consumer Vulnerability as a Shared Experience: Tornado Recovery Process in Wright, Wyoming, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 26, 1, pp. 6-19, (2007); (2020); Bell D.R., Chiang J., Padmanabhan V., The Decomposition of Promotional Response: An Empirical Generalization, Marketing Science, 18, 4, pp. 504-526, (1999); Blattberg R.C., Neslin S.A., Sales Promotion: Concepts, Methods, and Strategies, (1990); Charm T., Grimmelt A., Kim H., Robinson K., Lu N., Mayank, (2020); Corkery M., Maheshwari S., (2020); Deleersnyder B., Geyskens I., Gielens K., Dekimpe M.G., How Cannibalistic Is the Internet Channel?

The study further seeks the ways to resolve the problems faced by firms due to such biased decision-making. For this purpose, quantitative research method is used to uncover the new information for better understanding of study. The comparative analysis has been done through survey-based data collected from executives/managers of firms listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. The results indicate that overconfidence bias plays a significant role in managerial decisions for Pakistan compared with U.S. managers. This study applied mediation and moderation tests and found the significant mediating role of risk perception for overconfidence bias and manager decisions. The study further checked moderating role of cultural value, that is, the role of uncertainty avoidance between overconfidence bias of managers and risk perception. Hence, the role of cognitive biases and bounded rationality is undeniable for managerial decision-making and ultimate behavioral cost that firms have to pay due to undesired outcomes of situations. Consequently, this study has reached to extract the hidden facts and solutions to the observed issues for developed and emerging economy’s firms through cultural differences. © The Author(s) 2021.","culture; manager decisions; overconfidence bias; risk perception; uncertainty avoidance","","Aigbovo O., Ilaboya O.J., Does behavioural biases influences individual investment decisions, Benin City: University of Benin, 10, pp. 68-89, (2019); Azouzi M.A., Jarboui A., CEO emotional bias and capital structure choice.

Post-nonclassical science pays special attention to the subject of research and is focused on the way an individual affects all social processes, including the economic ones. Engineering design of the economy system based on the evolutionary algorithms is a matter of special research of many modern economists, being aimed at exposing most common patterns in the functioning of national cultures and national economics. Methodology. The main tool in interpreting the homo economicus model is a dynamic modeling of the ethnometric parameters, put forward by a Dutch sociologist G. Hofstede. Besides, some evidence pointing to the necessity to go on with homo economics modeling based on cultural “software of the mind”is provided and it is regarded as an additional proof of the thesis used in the humanities about the culture’s influence on economics. We developed the parial swap organization method for designing a model for economy system. Discussion. The homo economicus model is one of the most widely accepted in scientific community and at the same time, the most arguable one. The scientific community agrees that the homo economicus model plays a most significant role in nations’ well-being. Moreover, the thesis of culture’s impact on economy is most notable as it shifts the research focus towards culture study and sociology in investigating the homo economics models. Ethnometricindices suggested by G. Hofstede allow for correlation analysis being used in measuring such cultural issues as high level of individualism, high masculinity level, long-term life-orientation in the context of low power distance and low uncertainty avoidance as the crucial ones in promoting high national economicgrowth.Results. It is worth noting that notwithstanding the assurance of a great number of sociologists and economists that the above mentioned characteristics guarantee the well-being of the nation, none of the developed European countries proves the conclusion by the course of their development. In entails that the most appropriate in the situation will be the refusal of the universal homo economicus model and the shift towards the cultural peculiarities of individual nations in order to investigate their specific potential for economic development. Conclusion. It revealed that the using optimization algorithms in designing a dynamic model for economy canbe efficient. It goes without saying that the approaches, developed by G. Hofstede have a high heuristic potential for analyzing correlations of interconnection between culture and economics. However, it is obvious that a universal homo economicus model exists only in theory while its practical application results in deviations from an ideal model under the impact of specific traits of national cultures. And the latter has a substantial influence on the way of economic advancement. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: A multisource approach is used to collect data from a public-sector bank in India for testing our hypothesis. A hierarchical approach based on higher-order modelling has been deployed for confirming the path model. The foundation of the study is based on power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) cultural dimensions of Hofstede (1984). Findings: Employees in organizations with large PD and high UA index exhibit low readiness to change. Findings support a negative relationship of culture (large PD and high UA) with organizational readiness to change at the individual level. Research limitations/implications: The study has three major implications. First, measures and importance of change readiness at the individual level during corporate events such as M&A is elucidated in the study. Second, a paradigm for assessing higher-order models grounded in theoretical and methodological rigour for testing our hypothesis is presented in the paper. Last, the role of culture in M&A processes is highlighted vis-à-vis factors related to PD and UA on ORC. Practical implications: The findings of the research answer to the call for a study on factors that help in creating a synergy for successful M&A across all sectors especially in the banking sector. People representing high UA and large PD often look forward to direction and guidelines for guiding employee actions. Leaders therefore need to set clear agenda and effectively communicate the appropriateness of change to their employees for developing positive behaviour towards desirable organizational outcomes. This study touches upon this important perspective for its practical utilization. Originality/value: The study adds to the limited literature on change which addresses the need for studying socio-cultural factors in the M&A process, especially in an emerging economies context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Merger and acquisition; Organizational readiness to change; Power distance; Structural equation model; Uncertainty avoidance","","Ahammad M.F., Tarba S.Y., Liu Y., Glaister K.W., Cooper C.L., Exploring the factors influencing the negotiation process in cross-border M&A, International Business Review, 25, 2, pp. 445-457, (2016); Al-Ali A.A., Singh S.K., Al-Nahyan M., Sohal A.S., Change management through leadership: the mediating role of organizational culture, International Journal of Organizational Analysis, 25, 4, pp. 723-739, (2017); Alex W., Chan H., Cheung H.Y., Cultural dimensions, ethical sensitivity, and corporate governance, Journal of Business Ethics, 110, 1, (2012); Arazmjoo H., Rahmanseresht H., A multi-dimensional meta-heuristic model for managing organizational change, Management Decision, (2019); Arditi D., Nayak S., Damci A., Effect of organizational culture on delay in construction, International Journal of Project Management, 35, 2, pp. 136-147, (2017); Armenakis A.A., Harris S.G., Mossholder K.W., Creating readiness for organizational change, Human Relations, 46, 6, pp. 681-703, (1993); Backer T.E., Managing the human side of change in VA’s transformation, Journal of Healthcare Management, 42, 3, (1997); Bacon L.D., Bacon L.D., Using Amos for Structural Equation Modeling in Market Research, (2001); Bansal A., A revelation of employee feelings of alienation during post-mergers and acquisition: an outcome of perceived organizational justice, Journal of Organizational Change Management, 30, 3, pp. 417-439, (2017); Bonaime A., Gulen H., Ion M., Does policy uncertainty affect mergers and acquisitions?, Journal of Financial Economics, 129, 3, pp. 531-558, (2018); Breevaart K., Bakker A., Hetland J., Demerouti E., Olsen O.K., Espevik R., Daily transactional and transformational leadership and daily employee engagement, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 87, 1, pp. 138-157, (2014); Byrne B.M., Testing for multigroup invariance using AMOS graphics: a road less traveled, Structural Equation Modeling, 11, 2, pp. 272-300, (2004); Cartwright S., Price F., Managerial preferences in international merger and acquisition partners revisited: how are they influenced?, Advances in Mergers and Acquisitions, 2, pp. 81-95, (2003); Cartwright S.C., Cooper C.L., Managing Mergers Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances, (2016); Chatterjee D., Leadership in innovators and defenders: the role of cognitive personality styles in shaping them, Industry and Innovation, 21, 5, pp. 430-453, (2014); Chatterjee D., Management control systems and Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: an empirical study of innovators and low innovators, Global Business Review, 15, 3, pp. 565-582, (2014); Chaudhry A., Yuan L., Hu J., Cooke R.A., What matters more?

A three-step research process has been used, including literature review, qualitative interviews, and then a quantitative survey. The literature review and the qualitative interviews with university instructors guide the development of a causal model that suggests antecedents and outcomes for organisation justice in an educational setting. The nature, direction and magnitude of the proposed relationship between organisational justice and variables identified from the literature review and the qualitative phase are tested. Correlation, regression and analysis of variance are used to test the hypothesised model. The result provides insights on the nature of the relationship among these variables for finding effective means towards nurturing a positive educational environment where instructors are motivated to utilise their full potential in achieving educational goals. Findings show that instructors' demographic characteristics and cultural values explain the variance in perceived organisational justice and strong empirical evidence exists for the positive effect of perceived organisation justice on instructors' motivation. Perceived organisation justice mediates the relationship between instructors' cultural values and motivation.

These effects were first studied by prior studies which use Hofstede's cultural dimension data. The Hofstede's cultural data are constructed from survey data collected between 1967 and 1973. The data on corruption in bank lending taken from the world business environment survey (WBES), however, were collected between 1999 and 2000. This paper uses cultural data from the global leadership and organisational behaviour effectiveness (GLOBE) project which are constructed from survey data collected in the 1990s instead. The data from the GLOBE project are not only more recent but also provide more cultural dimensions than those of Hofstede. The results indicate that in-group collectivism still increases corruption in bank lending. The results suggest that assertiveness and uncertainty avoidance no longer have a significant effect on corruption in bank lending. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Bank lending; Collectivism.; Corruption; Culture","","Barth J.R., Caprio G., Levine R., Bank regulation and supervision: What works best?, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 13, 2, pp. 205-248, (2004); Barth J.R., Lin C., Lin P., Song F.M., Corruption in bank lending to firms: Cross-country micro evidence on the beneficial role of competition and information sharing, Journal of Financial Economics, 91, 3, pp. 361-388, (2009); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Levine R., Bank supervision and corruption in lending, Journal of Monetary Economics, 53, 8, pp. 2131-2163, (2006); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Maksimovic V., Bank competition and access to finance: International evidence, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 36, 3, pp. 627-648, (2004); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Maksimovic V., Financial and legal constraints to growth: Does firm size matter?, Journal of Finance, 60, 1, pp. 137-177, (2005); Boubakri N., Mirzaeib A., Samet A., National culture and bank performance: Evidence from the recent financial crisis, Journal of Financial Stability, 29, pp. 36-56, (2017); Dheera-Aumpon S., Can shareholder rights protection reduce corruption in lending?, International Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance, 8, 2, pp. 178-190, (2015); Djankov S., La Porta R., Lopez-De-Silanes F., Shleifer A., The law and economics of self-dealing, Journal of Financial Economics, 88, 3, pp. 430-465, (2008); El Ghoul S., Guedhami O., Kwok C.C.Y., Zheng X., Collectivism and corruption in commercial loan production: How to break the curse?, Journal of Business Ethics, 139, 12, pp. 225-250, (2016); Faccio M., Politically connected firms, American Economic Review, 96, 1, pp. 369-386, (2006); Fernandez D.R., Carlson D.S., Stepina L.P., Nicholson J.D., Hofstede's country classification 25 years later, Journal of Social Psychology, 137, 1, pp. 43-54, (1997); Hofstede G.H., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values, 2nd Ed, (2001); House R.J., Hanges P.J., Javidan M., Dorfman P.W., Gupta V., Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Houston J.F., Lin C., Ma Y., Media ownership, concentration and corruption in bank lending, Journal of Financial Economics, 100, 2, pp. 326-350, (2011); Kanagaretnam K., Lim C.Y., Lobo G.J., Effects of national culture on earnings quality of banks, Journal of International Business Studies, 42, 6, pp. 853-874, (2011); Kanagaretnam K., Lim C.Y., Lobo G.J., Effects of international institutional factors on earnings quality of banks, Journal of Banking Finance, 39, pp. 87-106, (2014); Kaufmann D., Kraay A., Mastruzzi M., The Worldwide Governance Indicators: Methodology and Analytical Issues, (2010); Trevino L.K., Victor B., Peer reporting of unethical behavior: A social context perspective, Academy of Management Journal, 35, 1, pp. 38-64, (1992); Wu M.-Y., Hofstede's cultural dimensions 30 years later: A study of Taiwan and the United States, Intercultural Communication Studies, 15, 1, pp. 33-42, (2006); Zheng X., El Ghoul S., Guedhami O., Kwok C.C.Y., Collectivism and corruption in bank lending, Journal of International Business Studies, 44, 4, pp. 363-390, (2013)","S.

This study focuses on the difference in relationships among some critical variables between two emerging economies with similar cultural indices. Design/methodology/approach: Survey questionnaire was used to collect responses from salespeople in two countries. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to provide support for the stated hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that Mexican and Indian salespeople differ in how their level of trust in supervisor, regulation of emotion, interpersonal conflict and felt stress related to drive turnover intention. Findings also confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on survey responses and should be interpreted with the associated limitations of method bias. The hypothesized model of relationships among constructs was based on theory and prior research, but researchers understand that there could be other statistically equivalent models with equal fit. Moreover, stress can result from numerous other combinations of variables in addition to those used in this model. The relationships among constructs as presented could also be due to the absence of other key variables. This study looked at turnover intentions from an employee perspective using responses made when economic conditions worldwide were robust. This is not the case today because of the global pandemic. Economic conditions wield substantial influence on employee responses as well as on turnover intentions. In addition, economic downturn lowers turnover potential and heightens stress level. Practical implications: Findings confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. Efforts to keep stress within a productive range should be encouraged, because while the direct costs of turnover can be substantial, indirect costs may be even greater. For example, when salespeople leave an organization, the customer relationships they formed and developed may be at risk, exposing their companies to potential reduction in revenue. Sales organizations that pay inadequate attention to high turnover rate among their salespeople become susceptible to a phenomenon Dudley and Goodson (1988) identified as “low sales recruiting ceiling syndrome.” Social implications: Most of the current studies results from developing countries have been compared to those from developed countries where the theories and seminal research originated. The outcome of the authors' research lends yet another argument in favor of more comparative studies on East versus East or developing economies versus developing economies. Such effort could further delineate the applicability of “foreign” theories and inform the development of “local” theories for richer insight on local management practice. The current drive to inject diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace should be reflected in the development of theory and the conduct of research. No one country or individual or group of individuals can claim ownership of theory development and standards for assessing theories originating elsewhere. Diversity, equity and inclusion have a place in academic research and should be encouraged. Second, the results obtained in this paper offer a cautionary note against over-generalization. Just as small details matter in life, likewise, small differences in variables that explain a phenomenon can make a big difference. Third, the findings confirm a strong positive relationship between felt stress and turnover intention. This is true for the two countries examined in this research. Originality/value: This study seeks to understand why potential drivers of turnover intention might manifest differently in countries that have a similar cultural outlook. The current research leverages the contingency theory and zeroed in on turnover intention. In addition, two additional cultural dimensions (long-term orientation and uncertainty avoidance) were incorporated, and the model was tested using salespeople (rather than plant workers). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Conflict;

Culture was proxied by power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. Belief was proxied by government regulation, government favoritism, and social regulation. Seventeen stock indices were selected, and the data employed in this research are stock returns during religious holidays commemorated by each country listed in the top world indices from 2016 to 2020. A quantitative method was employed and the data analysis was done using a multiple linear regression method with panel data. This research shows that individualism, government regulation, favoritism, and social regulation positively affect stock returns during religious holidays. This implies that investors recognize stock market characteristics to facilitate investment decision-making. It is recommended that investors maximize positive stock returns found in individualistic countries and countries with high government regulation, favoritism, and social regulation. © 2021 AESS Publications.

The current study attempts to do so by introducing organizational role ambiguity (ORA), operationalized as an organization's structured communication strategy about performance expectations between work role, division, and organization, as a correlate of UA. Data on ORA, risk-taking, and organizational satisfaction were collected from over 15,000 respondents in 20 countries and data on cultural values, wealth, sources of guidance, personality, and satisfaction were extracted from published data. Results show that ORA negatively correlates with UA and intellectual autonomy values, as well as organizational satisfaction, but positively correlates with risk-taking, masculinity values, lateral (coworkers as) sources of guidance, agreeableness, and job satisfaction. Thus, ORA, a construct organizations often assess in engagement and climate surveys, appears to be a reasonable correlate of UA. The country's cultural context of UA is reflected in the collective experience of an organization's communication structures within a given country. These findings have implications for organization's accessing their own, already available, ORA data to understand its implications on employee experiences, as well as for intercultural training and global research on occupational stress. © 2021","Cultural values; Personality; Role ambiguity; Satisfaction; Sources of guidance; Uncertainty avoidance; Wealth","adult; article; avoidance behavior; climate; coworker; cultural value; employee; expectation; high risk behavior; human; human experiment; job satisfaction; job stress; major clinical study; male; masculinity; organization; uncertainty","Allik J., McCrae R.R., Toward a geography of personality traits: Patterns of profiles across 36 cultures, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, pp. 13-28, (2004); Arrindell W.A., Hatzichristou C., Wensink J., Rosenberg E., van Twillert B., Stedema J., Meijer D., Dimensions of national culture as predictors of cross-national differences in subjective well-being, Personality and Individual Differences, 23, pp. 37-53, (1997); Basabe N., Paez D., Valencia J., Rime B., Pennebaker J., Diener E., Gonzalez J.L., Sociocultural factors predicting subjective experience of emotion: A collective level analysis, Psicothema, 12, pp. 55-69, (2000); Beehr T.A., Glazer S., Organizational role stress, Handbook of work stress, pp. 7-33, (2005); Beugelsdijk S., Maseland R., Van Hoorn A., Are scores on Hofstede's dimensions of national culture stable over time?

However, implementing and sustaining lean processes are easier in some organisations than in others. There may be societal culture differences, as the successes in initial implementation in Japan have not been followed by global success. As organisations accelerate their lean efforts to gain or maintain competitive advantage, studying societal cultural effects seems timely. Understanding of the societal culture that the firm or subsidiary is operating in would be useful in determining how lean processes should lead the effort. Using the cultural dimensions developed by Hofstede, we examine the interconnection of societal culture and lean processes. For example, a societal emphasis on individualism is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of individual employee involvement, individual creativity and firm efficiency. A societal emphasis on high uncertainty avoidance is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of control and standardisation, efficiency and long-term philosophy. A societal emphasis on high power distance is positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of control and standardisation, and efficiency. A long-term orientation in the society will be positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of all of the dimensions. A societal emphasis on femininity will be positively associated with a high level of lean process adoption, in terms of employee involvement, creativity and long-term philosophy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","lean management;

In 2014, there were more than 600 million obese people around the world. According to the data of the World Health Organization, obesity rates differ among countries. One possible underlying reason of the difference can be culture, more specifically shared cultural values. The strategies and policies regarding obesity were developed; however, the effect of culture is not adequately considered. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between obesity rates of countries, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, Schwartz’s values, and Gross National Income per capita per country. The data consist of obesity ranking (i.e., the percentage of the population with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or higher), Gross National Income per capita for each country, and cultural variables (i.e., Hofstede’s cultural dimensions for 54 nations and Schwartz’s cultural values for 57 nations). Hierarchical regression analysis results revealed that Gross National Income per capita was not a significantly related obesity at the aggregated level. Among Hofstede’s dimensions, individualism and uncertainty avoidance were positively associated with obesity, and long-term orientation was negatively associated with obesity. The relationship between Schwartz’s cultural values and obesity was not found to be significant. Findings suggest that Hofstede’s cultural dimensions should be considered when developing national level strategies and campaigns to decrease obesity. © The Author(s) 2018.","body mass index; culture;

This study bridges this gap through a four-level conceptual model of the role of uncertainty avoidance in the formation of employees’ intrapreneurial intentions, differentiating among unit- and country-level uncertainty avoidance. Using the established relationship between behavioral control and intentions, we consider how employee creativity and self-efficacy influence intrapreneurial intentions. Following the person-environment fit paradigm and the resulting fit traditions of complementarity and supplementarity, we narrow in on how these processes operate within specific (stimulating or inhibiting) cultural settings in terms of uncertainty avoidance at both the unit and country levels. Using data from 787 employees on the first level nested into 73 units on the second level, 19 organizations on the third level, and eight countries on the fourth level, study shows evidence for a beneficial interplay between unit-level uncertainty avoidance and creativity or self-efficacy when there is a supplementary or complementarity fit. The interplay between behavioral and contextual factors is negative, however, when neither type of fit applies. Finally, country-level uncertainty avoidance seems to be irrelevant to intrapreneurial intentions. © The Author(s) 2019.","creativity; intrapreneurial intentions; national culture; self-efficacy; uncertainty avoidance","","Ahlin B., Drnovsek M., Hisrich R.D., Entrepreneurs’ Creativity and Firm Innovation: The Moderating Role of Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy, Small Business Economics, 43, 1, pp. 101-117, (2014);

This study uses an international sample of banks from 75 countries and examines the direct effects of national culture on bank risk-taking behavior. We measure national culture with four dimensions - uncertainty avoidance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity and power distance - from Hofstede's framework of national culture. We find strong evidence that bank risk-taking is significantly higher in countries which have high individualism, low uncertainty avoidance, and low power distance cultural values. We confirm main results using alternate cultural dimensions from House et al. (2004. Culture, Leadership, and Organizations. Sage)'s framework of national culture, using alternative bank risk-taking proxies, and using instrumental variables analysis for endogeneity issues. This paper adds to our understanding by finding that cultural values lead to bank risk-taking decisions that may deviate in systematic and geographically predictable ways. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bank risk-taking; Banking regulations; Individualism; National culture; Uncertainty avoidance","","Acharya V.V., Amihud Y., Litov L., Creditor rights and corporate risk-taking, J.

Traditional studies used quantitative data, such as ratings, to measure eWOM. However, recent studies analyzed unstructured data, such as comments, through web-based text analysis. Based on recent research trends, we analyzed not only quantitative data, like ratings, but also text data, like reviews, and we performed a sentiment analysis using a text mining technique. Studies have also examined the effect of cultural differences on the decision-making processes of individuals and organizations. We applied Hofstede's cultural theory to eWOM and analyzed the moderating effect of cultural differences on eWOM influence. We selected 338 films released between 2006 and 2015 from the Box Office Mojo database. We collected ratings and reviews, box office revenues, and other basic information from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). We also analyzed the effects of cultural differences, such as power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, on box office performance. We found that user comments have a greater impact on film sales than user ratings, and movie stars and co-production contribute to box office success. We also conclude that cultural and geographical differences moderate the sentiment elasticity of eWOM. © 2019 by the authors.","Box office; Cultural difference; Electronic word-of-mouth; EWOM; Film industry; Sentiment analysis; Sustainable performance; Text mining","culture; data mining; decision making; detection method; film industry; sustainability","Minton E., Lee C., Orth U., Kim C.-H., Kahle L., Sustainable marketing and social media: A cross-country analysis of motives for sustainable behaviors, J.

An exploratory in-depth single case study in a multinational organization in Egypt was conducted. Specifically, 31 in-depth interviews were conducted with members of staff in marketing, IT, retail and customer services departments, and external prospects/customers. Based on an interpretive approach, the authors have articulated a situated cultural approach based on structuration theory to identify the cultural dimensions that have provided an understanding of the cultural influence on customers' channel choice. The results highlighted that verbal, human interaction, traditional shopping, and cash based were the themes for customers' channel choice through the four stages of customer life cycle. The results also show that the customers' channel choices were linked to the following Egyptian cultural dimensions: Collectivism, market price relationship, emotional, power distance, low trust, uncertainty avoidance, and universalism. © 2021 IGI Global.

It further examines the moderating effects of organisational size and uncertainty avoidance (UA) on the positive relationship between senior foreign manager and strategic change in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data econometrics and multilevel analyses were adopted to run the model. The author tests hypotheses on 263 emerging market firms (EMFs), originating from nine EMs. Findings: Empirical results reveal that senior foreign managers are active agents who can promote and implement strategic change in an organisation. They possess a different set of values, knowledge and experiences that can trigger strategic change. In addition, firm size and UA weaken the relationship between senior foreign manager ratio and strategic change of a firm. Practical implications: This study indicates that recruiting committees of EMFs should consider hiring senior foreign managers to foster a higher degree of strategic change. Nevertheless, firm size and UA may impose implementation difficulties for senior, foreign managers. As a result, the focal firm should be flexible and open to change. Originality/value: This study aims to contribute to strategic change and top management team internationalisation literature by promoting the role of senior foreign managers and national culture on strategic change. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Firm size;

However, most studies have been conducted at the country level, as there have been calls to conduct an investigation using intercountry evidence; therefore, studies that focus on country-level governance factors affecting CSP are scarce. Against this backdrop, the current study investigates country-level governance factors (i.e., Voice and Accountability; Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism; Government Effectiveness; Regulatory Quality; Rule of Law; and Control of Corruption) and national culture dimensions proposed by Hofstede (i.e., Power distance; Individualism; Masculinity; Uncertainty avoidance; Long-term orientation; and Indulgence) affecting CSP in an international context of 204 oil and gas firms cutting across 36 countries over a 10-year period (2011–2020). Result from the analysis using multivariate regression, generalised linear models regression and discriminant analysis reveals that the country-level governance factor strongly promoting CSP is the rule of law, whilst four of the national culture factor positively influence on CSP except power distance and masculinity. This current study contributes to knowledge by presenting empirical evidence that country-level and national culture factors affect CSP. The study, thus, argues for the inclusion of country governance factors and cultural dimension that may affect CSP in addition to other well-known factors affecting sustainability practice. The study also adds to literature by providing empirical support for the Hofstede Model on national cultural dimensions affecting accounting and organisational practice. © 2022 The Author(s).

A survey, in English, European Spanish, and Latin American Spanish respectively, was administered to 556 TikTok users across the three countries. These users shared similar demographic characteristics, and multigroup measurement models were established to support cross-country measurement invariance. Our results show that Chilean TikTokers are the least engaged on the platform, but have more followers on average than their American and Spanish counterparts. Additionally, users’ motivations for and uses of TikTok are associated with their countries’ national cultural values. For instance, TikTok users in Chile and Spain, which are collectivistic societies, view the platform as a socialisation tool more than users in the individualistic United States. Lastly, Chileans, who have a high uncertainty avoidance level, tend to avoid self-expression and archiving on TikTok compared to Americans, who have a low uncertainty avoidance level. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cross-cultural comparison; individualism; social media; Tiktok; uncertainty avoidance; uses and gratifications","Cross-cultural comparisons; Cross-cultural study; Demographic characteristics; Individualism; Latin americans; Multi-group; Social media; Tiktok; Uncertainty avoidance; Uses and gratifications; American; article; avoidance behavior; Chile; Chilean; cultural factor; cultural value; human; individuality; motivation; organization; social media; Spain; uncertainty; United States; Social networking (online)","Bossen C.B., Kottasz R., Uses and Gratifications Sought by pre-Adolescent and Adolescent TikTok Consumers, Young Consumers, 21, 4, pp. 463-478, (2020); Castillo A., Benitez J., Llorens J., Luo X.R., Social Media-Driven Customer Engagement and Movie Performance: Theory and Empirical Evidence, Decision Support Systems, 145, (2021); Craig C.S., Douglas S.P., International Marketing Research, (2005); Cuesta-Valino P., Gutierrez-Rodriguez P., Duran-Alamo P., Why do People Return to Video Platforms?

Culture shapes behaviors of people and distinguishes members of one group or category from another. The decision-making process depends greatly on cultural background. Executives’ financial decisions show variance from society to society as a result of their cultural differences. The objective of this study is to point out the effects of national culture on financial decision-making. We examined Hofstede’s cultural dimensions among 20 countries around the world to explain the variation of financial decisions based on cultural differences. According to our results, power-distance has an effect on all financial decisions included in the study, except for the capital structure. Individualism also has an influence on all the financial decisions we analyzed, except for Research & Development (R&D) expenditures. Uncertainty avoidance is found to have an effect on all of the financial decision parameters included here, except for discretionary accruals, which are an indication of a firm’s earnings-management decisions and can be considered as a clue for manipulation of earnings. Masculinity is found to have an effect only on capital structure and working capital level. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Capital structure; Discretionary accrual; National culture; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","","Albright J.J., Marinova D.M., Estimating Multilevel Models Using SPSS, Stata, SAS, and R, (2010); Chang C.H., Lin S.J., The effects of national culture and behavioral pitfalls on investors’ decision-making: Herding behavior in international stock markets, Int Rev Econ Fin, 37, pp. 380-392, (2015); Chang K., Noorbakhsh A., Does national culture affect international corporate cash holdings?, J Multinatl Fin Manage, 19, 5, pp. 323-342, (2009); Chen Y., Dou P.Y., Rhee S.G., Truong C., Veeraraghavan M., National culture and corporate cash holdings around the world, J Bank Fin, 50, pp. 1-18, (2015); Dechow P.M., Sloan R.G., Sweeney A.P., Detecting earnings management, Acc Rev, 70, pp. 193-225, (1995); Dimitratos P., Petrou A., Plakoyiannaki E., Johnson J.E., Strategic decision-making processes in internationalization: Does national culture of the focal firm matter?, J World Bus, 46, 2, pp. 194-204, (2011); Gelman A., Multilevel (Hierarchical) modeling: What it can and cannot do, Technometrics, 48, pp. 432-435, (2012); Griffin D., Li K., Yue H., Zhao L., Cultural Values and Corporate Risk-Taking, (2009); Griffin D.W., Li K., Yue H., Zhao L., How Does Culture Influence Corporate Risk-Taking?, (2012); Hofstede G., Motivation, leadership, and organization: Do American theories apply abroad?, Organ Dyn, 9, 1, pp. 42-63, (1980); Hofstede G., National culture in four dimension: A research-based theory of cultural differences among nations, Int Stud Manage Org, 13, 1-2, pp. 46-74, (1983); Hofstede G., Attitudes, values and organizational culture: Disentangling the concepts, Org Stud, 19, 3, pp. 477-498, (1998); Jaggi B., Low P.Y., Impact of culture, market forces, and legal system on financial disclosures, Int J Acc, 35, 4, pp. 495-519, (2000); Jones J.J., Earnings management during import relief investigations, J Acc Res, 29, pp. 193-228, (1991); Kanagaretnam K., Lim C.Y., Lobo G.J., Effects of national culture on earnings quality of banks, J Int Bus Stud, 42, 6, pp. 853-874, (2011); Kayo E.K., Kimura H., Hierarchical determinants of capital structure, J Bank Fin, 35, 2, pp. 358-371, (2011); Kurtz R.S., Organizational culture, decision making, and integrity: The National Park Service and Exxon Valdez, Public Integr, 5, 4, (2003); Li K., Griffin D., Yue H., Zhao L., How does culture influence corporate risk-taking?, J Corp Fin, 23, pp. 1-22, (2013); Jk M.-M., Do taxes affect corporate financing decisions?, J Fin, 45, 5, pp. 1471-1493, (1990); Mihet R., Effects of culture on firm risk-taking: A cross-country and cross-industry analysis, J Cult Econ, 37, 1, pp. 109-151, (2013); Nolder C., Riley T.J., Effects of differences in national culture on auditors’ judgments and decisions: A literature review of cross-cultural auditing studies from a judgment and decision making perspective, Auditing, 33, 2, pp. 141-164, (2013); Podrug N., Influence of national culture on decision-making style, SE Eur J Econ Bus, 6, 1, pp. 37-44, (2011); Raudenbush S.W., Bryk A.S., Hierarchical Linear Models: Applications and Data Analysis Methods, 1, (2002); Rehbein K., Does culture influence corporate risk taking?, Acad Manage Perspect, 28, 1, pp. 1-3, (2014); Sargut A.S., Kültürler Arası Farklılaşma Ve Y€onetim, (2001)","E.H.

A firm's CSR is influenced by the cultural context of a given society and, according to the upper echelons theory, the characteristics of its corporate executives. However, there was no empirical evidence on the moderating role of CEO narcissism, a common CEO characteristic in many cases, on the national culture-CSR relationship. This study finds that a firm with more properties in high-UA societies has less involvement in CSR and that CEO narcissism positively moderates the relationship. The results provide a meaningful empirical addition to the upper echelons literature by demonstrating how CEO traits can serve as a boundary condition in examining the impact of uncertainty avoidance, as a contextual factor, on CSR, as an organizational outcome, in the restaurant industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chief Executive Officer; Corporate Social Responsibility; Narcissism; Restaurant Industry; Uncertainty Avoidance","United States; boundary condition; corporate social responsibility; management; service sector","Adams M., Hardwick P., An analysis of corporate donations: United Kingdom evidence, Journal of Management Studies, 35, 5, pp. 641-654, (1998); Bhattacharya C.B., Sen S., Korschun D., Using corporate social responsibility to win the war for talent, MIT Sloan Management Review, 49, 2, (2008); Bowen F.E., Does organisational slack stimulate the implementation of environmental initiatives?, Proceedings of the International Association for Business and Society, 10, pp. 441-452, (1999); Brealey R.A., Myers S.C., Principles of corporate finance, (2003); Cameron A.C., Miller D.L., A practitioner's guide to cluster-robust inference, Journal of Human Resources, 50, 2, pp. 317-372, (2015); Campbell J.L., Why would corporations behave in socially responsible ways?

Drawing on the expectancy theory, this study aims to discuss the significant causal relationship between the implementation of single-rating, multi-rating 360° performance management (PM) and organizational outcomes such as trust, commitment, satisfaction and intention to leave. Design/methodology/approach: Using the self-reported measures and survey method, data were collected from 439 employees from different organizations across the UAE. Explanatory factor analysis, simple linear regression and multi-group were used to test the proposed conceptual model and examine the mediation and moderation impact. Findings: The study explored the best-practices attributes of the traditional single-rating, multi-rating 360° PM within a non-western context. This study also provides empirical evidence on the significant role of uncertainty avoidance and power distance orientation as a mediator between the relationship between these PMSs and trust, commitment, job satisfaction and intention to leave. Finally, this paper examined the effect of many demographic variables (such as gender, age, industry type […]) on the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Originality/value: This study extends research on PM theories and models. Another important aspect of this study is that its model has been tested on the UAE’s data, an underrepresented geographic region in the management literature. Given all the PM’s positive characteristics, the way that this feedback is viewed and interpreted by employees may be moderated according to the employee’s management level, age, gender and many other demographics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Intention to leave; Job satisfaction; Multi-rating PM system (PMS); National culture dimensions; Performance management; Power distance; Satisfaction; Single-rating PM system (PMS); Trust; UAE; Uncertainty avoidance","","Aguinis H., Performance Management, (2009); Aguinis H., Performance Management, (2006); Aguinis H., Joo H., Gottfredson R.K., Why we hate performance management – and why we should love it, Business Horizons, 54, 6, pp. 503-507, (2011); Ahmed I., Mohammad S.K., Islam T., The relationship between perceived fairness in performance appraisal and organizational citizenship behavior in the banking sector of Pakistan: the mediating role of organizational commitment, International Journal of Management and Innovation, 5, 2, pp. 75-88, (2013); Alcaraz J.M., Sugars K., Nicolopoulou K., Tirado F., Cosmopolitanism or globalization: the Anthropocene turn, Society and Business Review, 11, 3, pp. 313-332, (2016); Aly N.A.E.F.M., El-Shanawany S.M., The influence of performance appraisal satisfaction on nurses’ motivation and their work outcomes in critical care and toxicology units, European Scientific Journal, 12, 20, pp. 119-135, (2016); Anastasia A., Psychological Testing, (1988); Antonioni D., Park H., The relationship between rater affect and three sources of 360-degree feedback ratings, Journal of Management, 27, 4, pp. 479-495, (2001); Armstrong M., Performance Management: Key Strategies and Practical Guidelines, (2000); Armstrong M., A handbook of human resource practice 8th Ed Kogan page, (2001); Armstrong M., Baron A., Performance Management: The New Realities, (1998); Aryee S., Budhwar P.S., Chen Z.X., Trust as a mediator of the relationship between organizational justice and work outcomes: test of a social exchange model, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23, 3, pp. 267-285, (2002); At-Twaijri M.I., Al-Muhaiza I.A., Hofstede's cultural dimensions in the GCC countries: an empirical investigation, International Journal of Value-Based Management, 9, 2, pp. 121-131, (1996); Atwater L.E., Waldman D.A., Brett J.F., Understanding and optimizing multisource feedback, Human Resource Management, 41, 2, pp. 193-208, (2002); Bach S., Della Rocca G., The management strategies of public service employers in Europe, Industrial Relations Journal, 31, 2, pp. 82-96, (2000); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Basit A.A., Examining how respectful engagement affects task performance and affective organizational commitment: the role of job engagement, Personnel Review, 48, 3, pp. 644-658, (2019); Battaglia M.P., Non Probability Sampling.

Design/methodology/approach: Through the simple random sampling technique, the hypotheses were tested with a sample of 604 employees from a mobile telecommunication company operating in both China and Ghana, two countries that represent two same and opposite cultural poles on Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Findings: The results point that employee motives such as relationship, supervision, challenging work and achievement are moderated by cultural values. Whilst employees with high power distance cultural values are highly motivated by high supervision, those with low individualistic cultural values are highly motivated by high relationship. The results also depict that whilst the interaction effects between supervision and power distance and relationship and individualism on performance were marginal for both China and Ghana samples, the interaction effect of achievement and masculinity as well as challenging work and uncertainty avoidance on performance had great differences due to the different cultural values for the two countries. Practical implications: This study implies that, as organizations are devising strategies to lower personnel costs in a recessionary period, there is the need to redesign motivation factors that go beyond monetary means and based on the cultural background of an employee in order to improve performance.

Because social, cultural, and commercial interrelationships among countries have significantly increased since the introduction of this dimension, it would be advisable to revisit and investigate the substantiality of this dimension before making beneficial suggestions to people who engage in cultural encounters. A questionnaire was constructed, tested, edited, and distributed to 2,000 organizational members in Japan, France, Great Britain, and Singapore. Among the 1,258 questionnaires returned, 1,215 were included in the analysis. Not surprisingly, cultural differences among countries still exist. The findings of the present study suggest that cultural characteristics have become more complicated since the uncertainty-avoidance dimension was introduced four decades ago. To yield more detailed guidelines on cultural variabilities, future studies should examine factors such as education, generation gaps, occupations, religions, and degrees of intercultural contacts, along with how these factors influence variability among cultures. © 2021, Immigrant Institutet.

Since one of the main functions of intercultural competence is to minimize misunderstandings among culturally diverse individuals, the theoretical foundation appropriate for intercultural competence research and practice should be able to explain cultural variations among people and clarify how cultural uncertainty and anxiety can be managed. This chapter presents the foundational assumptions of culture and cultural studies, introduces the Uncertainty Reduction Theory as the foundational theory for intercultural competence investigation, and puts forward the premises of common models of intercultural competence research: overseas performance model, intercultural adjustment model, and intercultural effectiveness model. This chapter also explains the cultural context of organizations, including communication context richness, power distance, individualism and collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and performance or competitiveness. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Communication Competence; Host Culture; Reduction Theory; Uncertainty Avoidance; Uncertainty Reduction","","","","","Springer Nature","21928096","","","","English","Manag.

Specifically, we investigate the roles of three key dimensions of culture, namely collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and future orientation. The data of 16 countries during the period of 2010–2018 employed herein show robustly and significantly positive impact of future orientation but negative impact of uncertainty avoidance on savings ratio. However, the results concerning how collectivism plays role are not robust. With the collectivism variable from the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) Survey, we document negative effect on savings ratio, which is contrast to the findings of positive effect when we employ alternative measures of collectivism from two other surveys. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Collectivism;

Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was employed to collect data from 226 employees of participating suppliers after conducting mentorship training at the suppliers’ site. The data were analyzed by the partial least squares structural equation modeling with software SmartPLS Ver. 3.0. Findings: The empirical analysis indicates that SD by mentorship partially mediates the total effects of OC – power distance and uncertainty avoidance – on performance. It completely mediates the collaborative culture on performance. Originality/value: This study may confirm that the SD program by mentorship is a viable strategy to enhance the performance of supply chain partners and the selection of suppliers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative culture; Mentoring; Performance; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Surveys; Uncertainty analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Mentoring; Organizational cultures; Partial least square (PLS); Performance; Power distances; Structural equation modeling; Uncertainty avoidance; Personnel training","Adams G.L., Lamont B.T., Knowledge management systems and developing sustainable competitive advantage, Journal of Knowledge Management, 7, 2, pp. 142-154, (2003); Arroyo-Lopez P., Holmen E., de Boer L., How do supplier development programs affect suppliers?

We used methods of correlation and hierarchical regression to analyse two sets of indices; the global cybersecurity index of 2015 and Hofstede cultural dimension index. The research discovered that there exist a significant correlation between cybersecurity development and the cultural dimensions as defined by Hofstede cultural theory. Five cultural dimensions were used in the study; power distance, masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, long term/short term orientation, and the research found out that individualism and long term orientation were significantly correlated with cybersecurity development. These findings have strategic implications in helping government and decision makers fashion out relevant policies and programmes while taking into cognisance the cultural factors in the improvement of the cyberwellness profile and the development of strategic cybersecurity. Implications and recommendations for future work are further discussed. © 2017 IEEE.","Cybersecurity policies; National Culture; Strategic Cybersecurity","Decision making; Internet of things; Cultural dimensions; Cultural factors; Cyber security; Empirical studies; Hierarchical regression; Long-term orientation; National cultures; Uncertainty avoidance; Correlation methods","Global Cybersecurity Index and Wellness Profile, (2015); Flores W.R., Ekstedt M., A model for investigating organizational impact on information security ehavior"" (2012), WISP 2012 Proceedings, 12, (2012); Fang Z., An empirical study of cultural dimensions and egovernment development: Implications of findings and strategies, Behavior and Information Technology, 32, 3, pp. 294-306, (2010); Srite M., Karahanna E., The role of espoused national cultural values in technology, Mis Quaterly, 303, pp. 679-704, (2006); Zhang X., Maruping L.M., House hold Technology adoption in a global market place: Incorporating the role of espoused cultural values, Information Systems Frontiers, 10, 4, pp. 403-413, (2008); Dwyer S., Mesak H., Hsu M., An exploratory examination of the influence of national culture on cross national product diffusion, Journal of International Marketing, 13, 2, pp. 1-25, (2005); Hofstede G., Dimensionalizing cultures: The hofstede model in context, Online Readings in Psychology and Culture, 2, 1, (2011); Nakata C., Sivakumar K., National culture and new product development: An integrative review, Journal of Marketing, 60, 1, pp. 61-72, (1996); Straub D., Keil M., Brenner W., Testing the technology acceptance model across cultures: A three country study, Information Management, 33, 1, pp. 1-11, (1997); Mcsweeney B., Hofstedes model of national cultural differences and their consequences: A triumph of faith-a failure of analysis, Human Relations, 55, 1, pp. 89-118, (2002); Bond M.H., Reclaiming the individual from Hofstedes ecological analysisA 20-year odyssey: Comment on Oyserman et al.

Despite its importance, there are very few empirical studies investigating the planning horizon and its antecedents in travel research literature. This study contributes to bridging this gap by conceptualizing a two-level model of antecedents of travelers’ planning horizons. In addition to individual traveler- and trip-related aspects, the model provides a cross-cultural perspective on international travelers’ planning horizons by including uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and long-term orientation as cultural-level antecedents. Drawing on a nested dataset of 4,074 international travelers from 17 countries worldwide, the results of a two-level hierarchical regression model show that, in addition to individual-level aspects, cultural antecedents play an important role in determining planning horizons. Based on the empirical results, the paper discusses implications for theory and travel service providers. © The Author(s) 2022.","hierarchical linear modeling; national culture; travel planning; travel planning horizon","culture;

We investigate whether differences in individual countries' business cultures determine the distinguishing features of group decision making. In particular, this study compares groups categorised by agent, strategy, and the population of agents. Group characteristics are analysed based on the ranking by Hofstede (1980), along four dimensions - power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance, of Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The four experiments were conducted locally with graduate students at business schools in Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The results show that there are differences in the approach to cooperation among teams from each country as we hypothesised and that country-specific variables are the source of differences in behaviour. The research findings have implications of cultural dimensions on business practices and managerial behaviour. © Copyright 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Business simulation game; Contingency theory; Experiment; Group decision making; Individualism; Masculinity; National culture; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","","Alyousif A., Naoum S., Atkinson A., Robinson H., National culture influence on management practices in the construction industry of United Arab Emirates, Procs. 26th Annual ARCOM Conference, pp. 511-520, (2010); Axelrod R., Cohen M.D., Harnessing Complexity: Organizational Implications of a Scientific Frontier, (1999); Bond M.H., Reclaiming the individual from hofstede's ecological analysis -A 20-year odyssey: Comment on Oyserman et al.

A model is proposed that combines the technological, institutional, and cultural factors in order to examine country-level e-commerce adoption. Thus, interesting relationships among macro-level factors are hypothesized. The study is facilitated by the availability of authentic data published by reputable organizations such as UN and OECD. Moreover, the study is timely as e-commerce technology has now taken hold in several countries, therefore enabling us to draw data from a significantly larger sampling frame compared to earlier studies. This makes our findings more generalizable. The hypotheses are confirmed using PLS analytical procedures and the findings are reported. We discuss the results and their implications for researchers and practitioners.","E-commerce adoption; Efficacy of institutional safety-net; Government policy; Uncertainty avoidance","","Bagchi K., Cerveny R., Hart P., Peterson M., The influence of national culture in information technology product adoption, Proceedings of Americas Conference of Information Systems, pp. 957-965, (2003); Bureau U.C., Measuring the Electronic Economy: EStats, (2011); Chiu C.M., Wang E.T., Fang Y.H., Huang H.Y., Understanding customers' repeat purchase intentions in b2c ecommerce: The roles of utilitarian value, hedonic value and perceived risk, Information Systems Journal, 24, 1, pp. 85-114, (2014); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., The what and why of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior, Psychological Inquiry, 11, 4, pp. 227-268, (2000); Delone W.H., Mclean E.R., Measuring e-commerce success: Applying the delone and mclean information systems success model, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 9, 1, pp. 31-47, (2004); D'Onfro J., Wal-mart is Losing the War against Amazon, (2015); Dorfman P.W., Howell J.P., Leadership in western and asian countries: Commonalities and differences in effective leadership processes across cultures, The Leadership Quarterly, 8, 3, pp. 233-274, (1997); E-marketer, Worldwide Ecommerce Sales to Increase Nearly 20% in 2014, (2014); Europe E., European E-commerce Grew by 16% to Euro 363 Billion in 2013, 2014, (2013); Ferguson C.W., Yen D.C., A regional approach to e-commerce global expansion, International Journal of Electronic Business, 4, 1, pp. 99-114, (2006); Ghose A., Yao Y., Using transaction prices to re-examine price dispersion in electronic markets, Information Systems Research, 22, 2, pp. 269-288, (2011); Gibbs J.L., Kraemer K.L., A cross-country investigation of the determinants of scope of e-commerce use: An institutional approach, Electronic Markets, 14, 2, pp. 124-137, (2004); Grandon E.E., Nasco S.A., Mykytyn J., Comparing theories to explain e-commerce adoption, Journal of Business Research, 64, 3, pp. 292-298, (2011); Hassanein K., Head M., Manipulating perceived social presence through the web interface and its impact on attitude towards online shopping, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 65, 8, pp. 689-708, (2007); Ho S.-C., Kauffman R.J., Liang T.-P., A growth theory perspective on b2c e-commerce growth in Europe: An exploratory study, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 6, 3, pp. 237-259, (2007); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-related Values, (1980); Hofstede G., Hofstede G.J., Minkov M., Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, (2010); Hovakimian A., Kane E.J., Laeven L., How country and safety-net characteristics affect bank risk-shifting, Journal of Financial Services Research, 23, 3, pp. 177-204, (2003); Javalgi R., Ramsey R., Strategic issues of e-commerce as an alternative global distribution system, International Marketing Review, 18, 4, pp. 376-391, (2001); Kaba B., N'Da K., Meso P., Mbarika V.W., Micro factors influencing the attitudes toward and the use of a mobile technology: A model of cell-phone use in Guinea, IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, 52, 3, pp. 272-290, (2009); Kahneman D., Tversky A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 47, 2, pp. 263-291, (1979); Kalakota R., Whinston A.B., Electronic Commerce: A Manager's Guide, (1996); Kaufman-Scarborough C., Lindquist J.D., E-shopping in a multiple channel environment, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 19, 4, pp. 333-350, (2002); Kraemer K., Gibbs J., Dedrick J., Environment and policy factors shaping e-commerce diffusion: A crosscountry comparison, International Conference of Information Systems 2002 Proceedings, pp. 25-335, (2002); Lim K.H., Leung K., Sia C.L., Lee M.K., Is e-commerce boundary-less?

Whereas some authors emphasised that company characteristics, like the product demand profile, are significant factors in lean projects, other studies analysed the impact of national culture. This paper aims to study the combined effect of various factors related to national culture and company characteristics of lean implementation barriers in order to determine whether the environmental context in which the company operation can affect the outcome of lean project implementation. A survey has been conducted to collect information about companies of various sizes (small–medium–large) in all industry fields. Data from companies, including manufacturing firms, in 23 different countries, were analysed in depth by a combination of Association Rules and Network Analysis. The results show that some national culture dimensions, such as Performance Orientation and Gender Egalitarianism, influence lean management success and help to maintain a lean culture. Maintaining a lean culture is even more critical than developing it. Furthermore, if the implementation of lean practices is an arduous task for large organisations, it becomes even greater for SMEs. Other cultural factors of individuals such as Uncertainty Avoidance, Future Orientation and Institutional Collectivism also help to support a lean culture and overcome human and cultural barriers. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","association rules; barriers for lean implementation; Lean management; lean success factors; national culture","Lean production; Environmental contexts; Lean implementation; Lean management; Manufacturing firms; National cultures; Project implementation; Success factors; Uncertainty avoidance; Association rules","Abrahamsson L., Gender and the Modern Organization, Ten Years after, Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies, 4, 4, (2015); Achanga P., Shehab E., Roy R., Nelder G., Critical Success Factors for Lean Implementation within SMEs, Journal of Manufacturing Technology Management, 17, 4, pp. 460-471, (2006); Agrawal R., Imielinski T., Swami A., Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases.

The essential is to identify the specifics of the ŠKODA organizations culture in external assembly plants Aurangabad, Tianjin and Nizhny Novgorod in comparison with parent plant from Mladá Boleslav. In the theoretical part the paper occupies with the literature search of terms culture, organizational culture and multinational organizational culture. It is explained terms from these areas used by Czech and world literature. Based on orientation of the paper, the main emphasis is placed on differences in cultural dimensions. There are introduced two well-known approaches Hofstede's culture dimensions and Trompenaars's culture dimension. The basic element of the practical part is the survey in above mentioned plants. For the purpose of the survey the Value Survey Module 2013 from Geert Hofstede is used and based on this survey we gain results for power distance dimension, individualism dimension, masculinity dimension, uncertainty avoidance dimension, long-term orientation dimension and indulgency dimension. According these results we can characterize the types of organizational cultures in individual plants. In the following text, there are mentioned the most important conclusions and simultaneously, the facts are considered as the recommendations for potential manager working in these plants. © Serials Publications Pvt.

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative research method was used using a structured questionnaire as a tool to collect data from 251 respondents drawn from research institutions in Ghana. Data was analysed using simple regression and hierarchical multiple regression. In addition, a structural equation model was used to conduct confirmatory factor analyses to examine whether the variables in the hypothesized model for the study captured distinct constructs that the variables were designed to measure. Findings: The study revealed that functional diversity was positively related to team innovation. The study also found that functionally diverse groups are more innovative when they exhibit low uncertainty avoidance, femininity and low power distance. Practical implications: These findings suggest that practices such as team communication, honesty, respect and trust would foster team unity and commitment, which would enable members to share diverse expertise towards the creation and execution of new ideas and improvement of productivity in the country. Originality/value: The study examined the relationship between functional diversity and team innovation by examining the moderating role of some selected cultural dimensions (power distance, uncertainty avoidance and masculinity-femininity) in the relationship between functional diversity and innovation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Cultural dimensions; Functional diversity; Innovation; Teams; Training","Confirmatory factor analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Information processing theories; Multiple regressions; Quantitative research methods; Research institutions; Structural equation modeling; Uncertainty avoidance; Productivity","Apparao D., Garnevska E., Shadbolt N., Examining commitment, heterogeneity and social capital within the membership base of agricultural co-operative – a conceptual framework, Journal of Co-Operative Organization and Management, 7, 1, pp. 42-50, (2019); Aragie E., Artavia M., Pau K., Strategic public spending: scenarios and lessons for Ghana, (2019); Arrendado P., Shealy C., Neale M., Winfrey L.L., Consulting and Inter-Professional collaboration: modelling for the future, Journal of Psychology, 60, 7, pp. 787-800, (2004); Basadur M., Gelade G.A., The role of knowledge of management in the innovation process, Creativity and Innovation Management, 15, 1, pp. 45-62, (2006); Batanero M.F., Rotriguez-Martin A., TIC y diversidad functional: conocimiento del profesorado, European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education, 7, 3, (2017); Bennett L.M., Gadlin H., Collaboration and team science: from theory to practice, Journal of Investigative Medicine, 60, 5, pp. 768-775, (2012); Brabler M., Schultze M., Students’ innovation in education for sustainable development – a longitudinal study on interdisciplinary vs. Monodisciplinary learning, (2021); Brunetta F., Marchegiani L., Peruffo E., When birds of a feather don’t flock together: diversity and innovation outcomes in international R&D collaborations, Journal of Business Research, 114, pp. 436-445, (2020); Bolarinwa O.A., Principles and methods of validity and reliability testing of questionnaires used in social and health science researches, Nigerian Postgraduate Medical Journal, 22, 4, pp. 195-201, (2015); Bunderson J.S., Sutcliff K.M., Comparing alternatives conceptualizations of functional diversity in management teams: process and performance effects, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 5, pp. 875-893, (2002); Bryman A., Bell E., Business Research Methods, (2015); Soil research institute, staff profile, (2020); Cheung S.Y., Gong Y., Wang M., Zhou L., Shi J., When and how does functional diversity influence team innovation?

While it has long been recognized that individual socio-cultural preferences mitigate social interactions involving persons of power, there is limited empirical data on the underlying neural correlates. To bridge this gap, we asked university student participants to decide whether they were willing to engage in social activities involving their teachers (higher power status), classmates (equal power status), or themselves (control) while functional brain images were acquired. Questionnaires assessed participants' preferences for power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and cultural intelligence. As expected, participants generally accepted more social interactions with classmates than teachers. Also, left inferior frontal activity was higher when accepting than when rejecting social interactions with teachers. Critically, power distance preferences further modulated right lateral frontoparietal activity contrasting approach relative to avoidance decisions towards teachers. In addition, uncertainty avoidance modulated activity in medial frontal, precuneus, and left supramarginal areas distinguishing approach decisions towards teachers relative to classmates. Cultural intelligence modulated neural responses to classmate approach/avoidance decisions in anterior cingulate and left parietal areas. Overall, functional activities in distinct brain networks reflected different personal socio-cultural preferences despite observed social decisions to interact with others of differential power status. Such findings highlight that social approach or avoidance behaviors towards powerful persons involves differential subjective neural processes possibly involved in computing implicit social utility. © 2022 The Authors.

Culture and religion are believed to be influential sources of basic cultural assumptions. They are reflected in organizational culture. The hypothesis of this research assumes that religion has a meaningful impact on the basic assumptions of organizational culture. Religion in this research is understood as a cultural factor with the following dimensions: individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity/femininity), The main aim of the paper is to base oneself on the level of basic cultural assumptions to construct a model of organizational culture. This model will later be tested by a two-tiered verification process., which engages companies based and operating daily in varied religious surroundings. The scope this research has adopted includes organizational cultures of two enterprises. Both of them are based in the Podlasie region in Poland. This research is based on the method of a comparative case study developed on the basis of quantitative techniques in research. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Basic assumptions; Culture; Organizational culture; Religion","Cell culture; Computer programming; Computer science; Basic assumptions; Cultural factors; Human diversity; Organizational cultures; Quantitative techniques; Religion; Uncertainty avoidance; Verification process; Systems engineering","Alvesson M., The play of Metaphors, Postmodernism and Organizations, (1993); Alvesson M., Understanding Organizational Culture, (2002); Buchanan M., Iyer R., Karl C.A., The Case Study in Business Research.Iyer “Global Research Business, (1999); Gahan P., Abeysekera L., What shapes an individual’s work values?

Hospitality has also received much attention because it, among others, can produce and redistribute wealth whether in developed or developing economies, who often find it as an invaluable means of generating foreign income. Nonetheless, there is no combination of the three areas in a single study done in a developing economy. The paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of culture on the adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Hofstede’s culture model and technology acceptance model were used as underpinning theories to develop a research model which was operationalised into a 45-item questionnaire. A five-point Likert scale that ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree was used. The questions were closed-ended for the variables of the model, but there were also open-ended questions. Two Nigerian cities were purposely sampled and they generated 195 responses from the 400 questionnaires that were distributed. Correlation analysis was first done to establish relationships before regression analysis was performed after checking for multicollinearity. Findings and conclusions were drawn from significant hypotheses. Findings: The findings showed significant collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, femininity and short- and long-term orientations as factors that would affect adoption of KM in the hospitality industry of Nigeria. Power distance and individualism as factors, on the other hand, were not significant. Research limitations/implications: The research has produced a model that can form the basis for future research. The study apparently is the first and therefore needs replication in other industries and other developing economies. A comparative study can be done too between developing countries or between a developing and a developed country. Many replicated studies could perhaps produce a generic model that would apply beyond Nigeria. Moreover, as this study is on a moving target both in terms of culture and the extent of KM adoption, subsequent studies could update the findings of this study. Practical implications: Hospitality managers have to develop and maintain a conducive culture if adoption of KM is to be achieved. Managers should be sensitive to and take good advantage of cultural differences displayed in the personality traits of employees. For example, uncertainty avoidance (preference for precision) could be an asset to make knowledge explicit in computer systems, making it easier to share such knowledge in the organisation. Collectivism and nurturing orientation would encourage knowledge sharing and collaborative work, which is often nowadays done virtually. Managers should encourage knowledge workers to seek and acquire both short- and long-term views of their work. Originality/value: There apparently is no systematic empirical study that combines KM, hospitality and culture in developing economies’ context. Thus, this study examines the effects of culture on KM adoption in the Nigerian hospitality industry. The findings have practical implications on how the Nigerian hospitality industry can benefit from the application of KM. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Developing economies; Hospitality; Knowledge management; Nigeria","Cell culture; Developing countries; Human resource management; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Managers; Regression analysis; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Developing economies; Hospitality; Long-term orientation; Nigeria; Open-ended questions; Technology acceptance model; Uncertainty avoidance; Industrial economics","Adeola O., Ezenwafor K., The hospitality business in Nigeria: issues, challenges and opportunities, Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes, 8, 2, pp. 182-194, (2016); Agarwal R., Prasad J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new information technologies?, Decision Sciences, 30, 2, pp. 361-391, (1999); Ahmad T., Knowledge management for development: domains, strategies and technologies for developing countries: volume 35 of integrated series in information systems, Society and Business Review, 12, 3, pp. 400-402, (2017); Enhancing knowledge management: big data analytics and social media content, Strategic Direction, 33, 8, pp. 10-13, (2017); Assem P.B., Pabbi K.A., Knowledge sharing among healthcare professionals in Ghana, VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems, 46, 4, pp. 479-491, (2016); Barrows C.W., Powers T.F., Introduction to Management in the Hospitality Industry, (2009); Becerra-Fernandez I., Sabherwal R., ICT and knowledge management systems, Knowledge Management: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications, pp. 1042-1050, (2008); Becerra-Fernandez I., Gonzalez A., Sabherwal R., Knowledge Management: Challenges, Solutions and Technologies, (2004); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Statistics notes: Cronbach’s alpha, BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)., 314, 7080, (1997); Boge K., Salaj A.T., Practice vs theory: short-term financials trumps long-term value creation, Journal of Corporate Real Estate, 19, 3, pp. 186-204, (2017); Chen C.W., Modeling and initiating knowledge management program using FQFD: a case study involving a healthcare institute, Quality & Quantity, 46, 3, pp. 889-915, (2012); Chevers D., Spencer A., Customer satisfaction in Jamaican hotels through the use of information and communication technology, Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes, 9, 1, pp. 70-85, (2017); Choi B., Jong A.M., Assessing the impact of knowledge management strategies announcements on the market value of firms, Information and Management, 47, pp. 42-52, (2010); Chou S.-W., Hung I.H., Understanding knowledge outcome improvement at the post-adoption stage in a virtual community, Information Technology & People, 29, 4, pp. 774-806, (2016); Chu K.W., Beginning a journey of knowledge management in a secondary school, Journal of Knowledge Management, 20, 2, pp. 364-385, (2016); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-339, (1989); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R.P., Warshaw P., User acceptance of computer technology: a comparison of two theoretical models, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Davis F.D., A technology acceptance model for empirically testing new end-user information systems: theory and results, (1986); Doherty M., Probability versus non-probability sampling in sample surveys, The New Zealand Statistics Review, pp. 21-28, (1994); Dorfman P.W., Howell J.P., Dimensions of national culture and effective leadership patterns: Hofstede revisited, Advances in International Comparative Management, 3, pp. 127-150, (1988); Du Plessis M., The role of knowledge management in innovation, Journal of Knowledge Management, 11, 4, pp. 20-29, (2007); Earl M., Knowledge management strategies: towards taxonomy, Journal of Management Information Systems, 18, 1, pp. 215-233, (2001); Flammer C., Bansal P., Does a long-term orientation create value?

The aim of this study is to explore the impact of financial globalization and human capital on environmental degradation in One Belt One Road (OBOR) countries in a cultural context that is largely under-explored in spite of being immensely crucial for fulfilling the United Nations’ agenda on climate change mitigation. Owing to the presence of vast cultural differences, we check if the national scores on “Power Distance Index” and “Uncertainty Avoidance” in these countries matter for the environment. To this end, we use the latest and annual data set comprising 31 OBOR countries from 1996 to 2018, and employ panel econometric techniques that effectively deal with the threat of endogeneity. Results show that human capital improves environment while financial globalization deteriorates it. Interestingly, high power distance and uncertainty avoidance can reverse the positive impact of human capital. Similarly, financial globalization is favorable for environment in countries with low power distance and uncertainty avoidance. The findings are robust to the use of alternative specifications. Theoretical underpinnings and implications are discussed arising from the interesting reversal of traditional impacts in different cultural scenarios. Specifically, we recommend a culture of entrepreneurship, innovation, and inclusivity, promoted through increased tolerance towards risk-taking and participative decision-making to reap the benefits of human capital and globalization in improving the environment. Our results have important implications for climate change mitigation endeavors in OBOR countries and understanding the cultural context in this regard.

When comparing the organizations within the same country differences in national cultures are not relevant but become relevant in comparison between different countries. This paper intends to evidence whether the profitability of companies can be influenced by the national culture. In order to characterize the culture of each country, we used the Hofstede measure of cultural dimensions (1. Power Distance (PDI); 2. Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI); 3. Individualism (IDV); 4. Masculinity (MAS); 5. Long-Term Orientation (LTO); and 6. Indulgence vs Restraint (IND)). Sample was based on the 500 largest European companies rated by the Financial Times 2015. Profitability was measured by the ratios Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). Statistical tests were performed to test whether the means of the variables used to measure profitability are statistically equal. The results indicate that companies with higher profitability are from countries with lower Power Distance, lower Uncertainty Avoidance, Long-Term Orientation, and Higher Indulgence. © 2016, Virtus Interpress.

Based on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) model, this study investigates the consumer cognitive innovativeness and the moderating role of the individual consumer-level uncertainty avoidance cultural value towards new product purchase intention in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. Structural equation modelling, such as partial least squares (PLS) path modelling was used to test the model, using a sample of 255 participants in Australia who have had prior online shopping experience. The findings show that the online store web atmosphere influences consumers’ cognitive innovativeness to purchase new products in countries with diverse degrees of uncertainty avoidance such as Australia. The results provide some guidance for a B2C website design based on how individual’s uncertainty avoidance and cognitive innovativeness can aid the online consumer purchasing decision-making process.

This study aimed to investigate how culture influences trust and the consequential global supply chain through the computerized supply chain management experiment, which was conducted with a two-echelon supply chain involving retailers and wholesalers. In the experiment, forty-two participants with supply chain management background from seventeen countries were asked to take the role of wholesalers in the supply chain and to develop ordering strategies in response to the quantity forecast generated by a computer. The uncertainty avoidance index proposed by Hofstede was applied to quantify the definition of culture in this study. Results indicated that participants from countries with low uncertainty avoidance index present a higher trust level than those with a high uncertainty avoidance index. This study can offer managers a theoretical backup on how to best utilize cultural information to develop and maintain successful global supply chain relationships. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cross-cultural; Decision making; Supply chain management; Trust; Uncertainty avoidance","Human computer interaction; User experience; Cultural factors; Cultural informations; Experimental analysis; Global supply chain; Global supply chain management; Ordering strategy; Two-echelon supply chain; Uncertainty avoidance; Supply chain management","Fawcett S.E., Magnan G.M., Williams A.J., Supply chain trust is within your grasp, Supply Chain Manag.

Social media create ample opportunities for organizations to improve competitiveness and efficiency of marketing and communications. We empirically investigate the impact of employee cultural dimensions on social media usage at work and at home. Such a study has not been undertaken before to the best of our knowledge and this would be the first study to connect cultural dimension characteristics of individuals with social media usage. Specifically, we investigate the effect of Power Distance (PD), Uncertainty Avoidance (UA), and Individualism-Collectivism (IC) on the use of popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, and LinkedIn. Our results show that certain cultural dimensions predict higher or lower levels of use of specific social media platforms. We provide implications of our results on research and practice. © 2017 Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.

A three-step research process has been used, including literature review, qualitative interviews, and then a quantitative survey. The literature review and the qualitative interviews with university instructors guide the development of a causal model that suggests antecedents and outcomes for organisation justice in an educational setting. The nature, direction and magnitude of the proposed relationship between organisational justice and variables identified from the literature review and the qualitative phase are tested. Correlation, regression and analysis of variance are used to test the hypothesised model. The result provides insights on the nature of the relationship among these variables for finding effective means towards nurturing a positive educational environment where instructors are motivated to utilise their full potential in achieving educational goals. Findings show that instructors' demographic characteristics and cultural values explain the variance in perceived organisational justice and strong empirical evidence exists for the positive effect of perceived organisation justice on instructors' motivation. Perceived organisation justice mediates the relationship between instructors' cultural values and motivation.

The examination significantly handles the theoretical composing identified with various implications of culture and its association with organization and comes up finally with the results and ideas. Moreover, the analysts inspect whether financial circumstances, for instance, the nature of competition and operational age and size, can choose the degree and the course of the relationship. Market competition seems to impact the course of the relationship, while operational age and size impact the relevant degree. The disclosures reveal a strong association between these two operational factors, while elements’ coordination (indistinguishable social sort and leadership style) carries out this relationship. These results are according to Hofstede’s work 1980, which is the most extensively alluded to work in presence on a comparative subject. To make public social profiles, Hofstede used a five estimations gadget (Power Distance, Individualism vs. Collectivism, Uncertainty avoidance, Long-term orientation).

Error orientation has been related to organizations’ safety and quality culture. The present study examined country-level differences in error orientation and its relation to cultural values and personality dimensions. The sample consisted of employees (N = 464) working for an international enterprise. The employees were located in eight different countries: China, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, USA, and Vietnam. Significant country-level differences in mean error orientation were found, e.g. USA reported the highest mean level, Japan the lowest. All cultural values, but uncertainty avoidance, had a significant relationship with error orientation: employees high in collectivism and long-term orientation had a significantly higher score on error orientation, while employees high in power distance and masculinity showed a significantly lower score. Error orientation also related to personality: employees high in extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness had a significantly higher score on error orientation while employees high in neuroticism showed a significantly lower score. However, both culture and personality could not fully explain the differences in error orientation between countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-cultural differences; Cultural values; Error management; Error orientation; Personality dimensions","Personnel; Cross-cultural differences; Cultural value; Error management; International enterprise; Learning from errors; Long-term orientation; Personality dimensions; Uncertainty avoidance; agreeableness; Article; Asia; attitude; China; collectivism; conscientiousness; cultural anthropology; employee attitude; error orientation; Europe; extraversion; human; Hungary; Japan; Malaysia; masculinity; Netherlands; neurosis; North America; openness; personality; priority journal; Viet Nam; Errors","Abraham J.D., Morrison J.D., Validity study relationship between the performance perspectives inventory's conscientiousness scale and job performance of corporate security guards, Appl.

National culture can influence the ways managers cope with uncertainty, and their subsequent business decisions, as was described in seminal research by Hofstede (1991). By their very nature, cross-border acquisitions require that managers deal with different cultures and higher levels of uncertainty. We seek to understand how national culture affects value in cross-border acquisitions using data from the Asia-Pacific Rim region over the period between 2000 and 2009. The countries of this region have large cultural differences and the potential gains from acquisitions are very substantial, so these data are an excellent population for analysis. Our results show that different national cultures have an important influence on financial decisions by firms in ways consistent with classic research by Knight (2006), and also that different national cultures cope with uncertainty in different ways. We find that acquirers from countries with a high aversion to uncertainty conduct fewer cross-border acquisitions. Further, these high uncertainty aversion firms pay a higher price for control in cross-border deals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Acquisitions; Cross-border; Culture; Financial decision making; Pacific-Rim countries; Uncertainty avoidance","","Ahern K.R., Daminelli D., Fracassi C., Lost in translation?

The groups discussed in this chapter are organizational, professional, and societal. It is essential that these cultures be considered before starting Six Sigma implementation and when working in Six Sigma teams. Cross-cultural problems arise because the differences and resulting complications are not acknowledged, accepted, and solved. The final section of this chapter is a discussion of methods to make changes that may be needed in culture before a Six Sigma team can be effective. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Competing Values Framework;

The purpose of this work is to better understand the complex organization of psyche, language, and culture. The process of hyper-generalization brings affective and cognitive opposites into the whole sign field and guides the whole relating with the world. As well, the process of semiotic mediation entails signs constraining and enhancing both interpersonal and intrapersonal psychological processes and experiences, including through nested systems (the levels of the individual-the relationship-the community-the societal). We present data for Australia and Thailand on Hofstede’s six culture dimensions, that is, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity/femininity, individualism/collectivism, short-term/long-term orientation & restraint/indulgence. An idealized and dynamic model of relations of Hofstede’s six culture dimensions and four indeterminate pronouns (e.g., ‘every’-one, ‘some’-one, ‘any’-one, ‘no’ one) is proposed. As a framework for construing the complex semiotic organization of (western, English-speaking) culture and psyche, four “cyclical” regulatory statements are outlined, regarding personal constraint, personal enhancement, cultural constraint, and cultural enhancement in language and culture, that is, in semiotic cultural psychology. Examples on the values of caring for people and planet are given to illustrate the social-ecological semiotic framework. © The Author(s) 2024.","complex organization; constraint; Culture; enhancement; semiotic signs","","Abrams J.F., Huntingford C., Williamson M.S., Armstrong McKay D.I., Boulton C.A., Buxton J.E., Sakschewski B., Loriani S., Zimm C., Winkelmann R., Lenton T.M., Committed global warming risks triggering multiple climate tipping points, Earth's Future, 11, 11, (2023); Ahlqvist M., Andersson A.S., How values lead to barriers - a matter of life and death in a developing country.

Although comparative studies across different countries have been conducted, little is known about the effects of individual cultural differences in this context. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of individual and national cultures in knowledge sharing. The individual cultural characteristics of power distance, individualism/collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance are incorporated into the model as antecedents of knowledge-sharing motivations (organizational rewards, image, and reciprocal benefits). National cultural differences are examined by subjects conducted in the U.S. and China. Results show that power distance is significantly related to reciprocal benefits for the U.S. but not for China. Individualism/ collectivism is related to organizational rewards and image for the U.S. but not for China, while individualism/collectivism is significantly related to reciprocal benefits for China but not for the U.S. Uncertainty avoidance is significantly related to reciprocal benefits for the U.S. but not for China. This study provides knowledge-sharing practices and managements for multinational companies attempting to motivate U.S. and Chinese employees to share knowledge. © 2016, IGI Global.","Knowledge sharing; Motivation; National culture; Social exchange theory","Human resource management; Information management; Motivation; Social sciences; Comparative studies; Cultural difference; Individualism collectivisms; Knowledge-sharing; Multi-national companies; National cultures; Social exchange theory; Uncertainty avoidance; Knowledge management","Andreassen T.W., Satisfaction, loyalty and reputation as indicators of customer orientation in the public sector, International Journal of Public Sector Management, 7, 2, pp. 16-34, (1994); Blau P.M., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Bock G.W., Kim Y.G., Breaking the myths of rewards: An exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing, Information Resources Management Journal, 15, 2, pp. 14-21, (2002); Bock G.W., Zmud R.W., Kim Y.G., Behavioral intention formation in knowledge sharing: Examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate, Management Information Systems Quarterly, 29, pp. 87-111, (2005); Chen C.C., Cameron M.F., George F.F., Do rewards benefit the organization?

For this purpose, they refer to the effectiveness of value congruency and develop a conceptual model describing the fit between organizational culture types as suggested by the competing values framework and national culture, as described by Hofstede's cultural dimensions. The meta-analysis is based on 489 effect sizes taken from 123 manuscripts. The findings show that organizations with a market culture show the highest new product performance, while hierarchy-type organizations show the lowest performance. The influence of national culture variables supports the effect of value congruency, and shows that in individualistic cultures the impact of a clan culture decreases, the impact of an adhocracy culture type decreases with uncertainty avoidance, and the influence of a hierarchy culture type increases with power distance. The superior effect of a market culture type can be matched by other organizational orientations, but in particular national cultures only. The combined findings underline the importance for firms that seek to improve the success rate of new products on international markets to consider the fit of a national culture with a firm's organizational culture. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association.","","International trade; Competing values frameworks; Conceptual model; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; International markets; National cultures; New product performance; Organizational cultures; Uncertainty avoidance; Commerce","Atuahene-Gima K., The effects of centrifugal and centripetal forces on product development speed and quality: How does problem solving matter?, Academy of Management Journal, 46, 3, pp. 359-373, (2003); Atuahene-Gima K., Resolving the capability-rigidity paradox in new product innovation, Journal of Marketing, 69, pp. 61-83, (2005); Atuahene-Gima K., Slater S.F., Olson E.M., The contingent value of responsive and proactive market orientations for new product program performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 22, pp. 464-482, (2005); Baker W.E., Sinkula J.M., The synergistic effect of market orientation and learning orientation on organizational performance, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 27, 4, pp. 411-427, (1999); Belassi W., Kondra A.Z., Tukel O.I., New product development projects: The effects of organizational culture, Project Management Journal, 38, 4, pp. 12-24, (2007); Bonner J.M., Ruekert R.W., Walker Jr.O.C., Upper management control of new product development projects and project performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 19, pp. 233-245, (2002); Buschgens T., Bausch A., Balkin D.B., Organizational culture and innovation: A meta-analytic review, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 30, 4, pp. 763-781, (2013); Calantone R.J., Cavusgil S.T., Zhao Y., Learning orientation, firm innovation capability, and firm performance, Industrial Marketing Management, 31, 6, pp. 515-524, (2002); Calantone R.J., Garcia R., Droge C., The effects of environmental turbulence on new product development strategy planning, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 20, pp. 90-103, (2003); Calantone R.J., Harmancioglu N., Droge C., Inconclusive innovation ""returns"": A meta-analysis of research on innovation in new product development, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, pp. 1065-1081, (2010); Cameron K.S., Quinn R.E., DeGraff J., Thakor A.V., Competing Values Leadership: Creating Value in Organizations, (2006); Chang D.R., Cho H., Organizational memory influences new product success, Journal of Business Research, 61, pp. 13-23, (2008); Chen C.-J., Information technology, organizational structure, and new product development - The mediating effect of cross-functional team interaction, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 54, 4, pp. 687-698, (2007); Chen S.-F.S., The motives for international acquisitions: Capability procurements, strategic considerations, and the role of ownership structures, Journal of International Business Studies, 39, pp. 451-471, (2008); Chien S.-H., Chen J., Supplier involvement and customer involvement effect on new product development success in the financial service industry, Service Industries Journal, 30, 2, pp. 185-201, (2010); Cooper R.G., How new product strategies impact on performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 1, pp. 5-18, (1984); Dayan M., Managerial trust and NPD performance: Team commitment and longevity as mediators, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 25, 2, pp. 94-105, (2010); Dayan M., Basarir A., Antecedents and consequences of team reflexivity in new product development projects, Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 25, 1, pp. 18-29, (2010); Dayan M., Di Benedetto C.A., Antecedents and consequences of teamwork quality in new product development projects.

In this way, accounting supervisors influence not only the end users of accounting information, but also subordinates who learn about the accounting profession from them. In investigating collusive supervision, I utilize a field-based instrument and a sample of practicing accounting supervisors. I find that accounting supervisors’ behavioral intentions to encourage their subordinates to collude in manipulating accounting information are influenced by attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and materialism. I investigate cultural influences on these relationships. I find that power distance and collectivism increase the likelihood that an accounting supervisor will encourage subordinates to collude in manipulating accounting information. Uncertainty avoidance, or rule orientation, decreases the likelihood. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling illustrates direct and indirect cultural effects. The findings suggest that adding relevant cultural variables to the Theory of Planned Behavior and considering related mediation effects can increase the framework’s capacity to explain behaviors in international or cross-cultural settings. Ramifications for subordinates, educators, the accounting profession, organizations, and policy makers are discussed. © 2016, American Accounting Association.

There however remains a research gap in assessing how within-group, intra-cultural variations between individual values and attitudes can affect the attribution of accident causes, particularly in culturally diverse environments. The present research involved thirty (N = 30) accident investigators’ categorisation of causal factors of the same incident using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) [1]. Rather than using geopolitical countries to categorise participants into groups, individual cultural values were assessed using Hofstede’s six-dimension model in order to capture intra-cultural variations [2]. The frequency of participants selecting a HFACS category as contributory were compared with their six Hofstede’s dimensions. It was discovered that the attribution of accident causes to categories in the Unsafe Acts of Operators level (HFACS Level 1) were driven by the investigators’ Power Distance and Long-Term Orientation dimensions; categories in the Preconditions of Unsafe Acts level (HFACS Level 2) were unaffected by investigators’ Hofstede’s dimensions; and the higher HFACS levels concerning supervisory and organisational influences (Levels 3 and 4) were moderated by Uncertainty Avoidance and Long-Term Orientation. Findings of the present research can provide insight into sources of bias in accident investigations and inform adjustments for consequential training and operational changes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accident investigation; Aviation training; Cultural differences","Ergonomics; Training aircraft; Accident investigation; Accident investigators; Classification system; Factors analysis; Long-term orientation; National cultures; Operational changes; Uncertainty avoidance; Aircraft accidents","Hofstede G., Hofstede G.J., Minkov M., Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, Intercultural Cooperation and Its Importance for Survival, Cultures and Organizations, (2010); Shappell S., Detwiler C., Holcomb K., Hackworth C., Boquet A., Wiegmann D.A., Human error and commercial aviation accidents: An analysis using the human factors analysis and classification system, Hum.

We first extend the prior research using the six measurable cultural dimensions of Hofstede et al. [(2010). Culture and Organizations: Software of the Mind, Intercultural Cooperation and Its Importance for Survival, 3rd Edition. New York: McGraw Hill], along with the largest panel database currently available, containing 84 countries over the period 1981-2012, on culture-related variables and saving rates, to test our hypothesis that cultural factors can influence private saving behavior in an international context. We then focus our study on three main cultural variables in East Asian countries - Confucianism, Long-term Orientation (LTO) and Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) - and find that they all have significant impacts on private saving rates around the world. Our findings also potentially solve the puzzle of why China, Japan and other East Asian countries save so much and so persistently since we find that the high LTO measures within these regions determine their high levels of private savings, whilst their low UA measures explain the persistence of their high saving rates, even during a period of financial crisis.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Confucianism; Long-term orientation; private saving; uncertainty avoidance","Far East; culture; financial crisis; private sector; religion; savings behavior","Adams FG, Prazmowski PA, Why are saving rates in East Asia so high?

The European Cancer Consumer Quality Index (ECCQI) is a validated tool for international benchmarking of patient experiences and satisfaction. This study aimed to further validate the ECCQI in larger and more uniform groups of high volume tumours such as breast and prostate cancer. A second objective was the verification of the influence of cultural factors of the country to determine its possible use in international benchmarking. Methods: Data from two survey studies in eight European countries were combined. Socio-demographic correlations were analysed with Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to validate internal consistency. Influences of masculinity (MAS), power distance (PD) and uncertainty avoidance (UA) were determined by linear regression analysis in a general model and subgroup models. Results: A total of 1322 surveys were included in the analysis (1093 breast- and 348 prostate cancer patients). Cronbach’s alpha was good (α ≥ 0.7) or acceptable (0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.7) in 8 out of 9 questionnaire categories, except in the category ‘Safety’ (α = 0.305). Overall ECCQI scores ranged from 22.1 to 25.1 between countries on a 1–35 scale (categories had a 1–4 scale). In certain subcategories such as ‘Organisation’ (range 2.2 vs 3.0) and ‘Supervision & Support’ (range 3.0 vs 3.8) a large difference was observed between countries. Differences in ‘Overall opinion’ were however small: mean scores of 3.7 vs 3.9, whereas median scores were all the maximum of 4.0. Power distance was positively associated with higher patient satisfaction scores whereas Uncertainty avoidance was negatively associated with these scores. Masculinity was only associated with patient satisfaction scores in lower educated patients. We found the highest impact of culture on overall scores in Hungary and Portugal and the lowest in Romania. Conclusions: The ECCQI shows high internal consistency in all categories except ‘Safety’. Especially in separate categories and overall ECCQI scores the questionnaire showed discriminative value. This study showed a positive correlation of power distance and a negative correlation for uncertainty avoidance in some countries. When using the ECCQI for international benchmarking these two dimensions of culture should be taken into account. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cancer care; Consumer quality; Cultural dimensions; Patient satisfaction","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Benchmarking; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Safety; Patient Satisfaction; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Uncertainty; Young Adult; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; cultural factor; demography; European Cancer Consumer Quality Index; female; human; Hungary; information processing; internal consistency; major clinical study; male; masculinity; middle aged; patient satisfaction; Portugal; power distance; prostate cancer; questionnaire; Romania; scoring system; uncertainty avoidance; adolescent; benchmarking; breast tumor; cancer survivor; Europe; patient safety; patient-reported outcome; prostate tumor; psychology; reproducibility; uncertainty; young adult","Ouwens M., Hermens R., Hulscher M., Vonk-Okhuijsen S., Tjan-Heijnen V., Termeer R., Et al., Development of indicators for patient-centred cancer care, Support Care Cancer, 18, 1, pp. 121-130, (2010); Committee on health Care in America: crossing the quality chasm: a new health system for the 21st century, (2001); Booij J.C., Zegers M., Evers P.M., Hendriks M., Delnoij D.M., Rademakers J.J., Improving cancer patient care: development of a generic cancer consumer quality index questionnaire for cancer patients, BMC Cancer, 13, (2013); Wessels H., de Graeff A., Wynia K., de Heus M., Kruitwagen C.L., Teunissen S.C., Et al., Are health care professionals able to judge cancer patients’ health care preferences correctly?

Using daily data from 34 countries over the period 23 January to 12 June 2020, and measuring investors’ attention with the Google search volume (GSV) of the word “coronavirus” for each country, we find that investors’ enhanced attention to the COVID-19 pandemic results in negative stock market returns. Further, measuring the national culture with the uncertainty avoidance index (the aspect of national culture which measures the cross-country differences in decision-making under stress and ambiguity), we find that the negative impact of investors’ attention on stock market returns is stronger in countries where investors possess higher uncertainty avoidance cultural values. Our findings imply that uncertainty avoidance cultural values of investors promote financial market instability amid the crisis. © 2020 by the authors.

In Taiwan, the Ministry of Education launched a curriculum reform in 2019. To determine how to enhance school agency for the policy, we explored the individual and contextual factors affecting receptivity to the new curriculum. With a survey design, this study recruited secondary school teachers and principals throughout Taiwan as samples. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to examine the effects of individual factors (conceptions of distributed leadership and collective learning) and organizational culture (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and academic emphasis) on practitioners’ receptivity to curriculum reform. Both the main and interactive effects were investigated. The results indicate that respondents who positively conceived distributed leadership and collective learning were more receptive to change. Regarding the three indicators of organizational culture, we found no significant effect of power distance, while the main effect of uncertainty avoidance and the moderation effect of academic emphasis existed. Those who perceived their schools with high uncertainty avoidance levels were more resistant to reform efforts. Besides, a positive linkage between teacher conception of collective learning and affection for change was more evident in schools with less academic emphasis. Our study suggests that school reforms must be understood within the individual and school contexts. The finding about the moderation effect of academic emphasis furthermore signifies the cultural implication in Asian societies. © 2023, De La Salle University.","Academic emphasis; Collective learning; Distributed leadership; Power distance; Receptivity to change; Uncertainty avoidance","","Amels J., Kruger M.L., Suhre C.J.M., van Veen K., The effects of distributed leadership and inquiry-based work on primary teachers’ capacity to change: Testing a model, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, 31, 3, pp. 468-485, (2020); Beard K.S., Hoy W.K., Hoy A.W., Academic optimism of individual teachers: Confirming a new construct, Teaching and Teacher Education, 26, 5, pp. 1136-1144, (2010); Chen W.-Y., Pan H.-L.W., The effect of principal leadership on teacher leadership for learning: How trust and academic emphasis moderate?, Journal of Research in Education Sciences, 64, 1, pp. 119-147, (2019); Chen W.Y., The effects of school middle leaders’ conceptions of power and curriculum on their curriculum change behavior intention, Educational Policy Forum, 24, 2, pp. 107-139, (2021); Coburn C.E., Collective sensemaking about reading: How teachers mediate reading policy in their professional communities, Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 23, 2, pp. 145-170, (2001); Crawford M., Solo and distributed leadership: Definitions and dilemmas, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 40, 5, pp. 610-620, (2012); Darling-Hammond L., Teacher learning that supports student learning, Teaching for Intelligence, 2, 1, pp. 91-100, (2008); Davis K.S., Change is hard"": What science teachers are telling us about reform and teacher learning of innovative practices, Science Education, 87, 1, pp. 3-30, (2003); Fang D.L., An Inquiry into the development and review process of the 12-year Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines, Journal of Education Research, 298, pp. 56-78, (2019); Fullan M., Hargreaves A., Teacher development and educational change, Teacher development and educational change, pp. 1-9, (2013); Fullan M., The new meaning of educational change, (2016); Goddard Y., Goddard R., Tschannen-Moran M., A theoretical and empirical investigation of teacher collaboration for school improvement and student achievement in public elementary schools, Teachers College Record, 109, 4, pp. 877-896, (2007); Gouedard P., Pont B., Hyttinen S., Huang P., Curriculum reform: A literature review to support effective implementation, OECD Education Working Papers No, (2020); Gray J., Kruse S., Tarter C.J., Enabling school structures, collegial trust and academic emphasis: Antecedents of professional learning communities, Educational Management Administration & Leadership, 44, 6, pp. 875-891, (2016); Gronn P., Distributed properties: A new architecture for leadership, Educational Management & Administration, 28, 3, pp. 317-338, (2000); Gronn P., Distributed leadership as a unit of analysis, The Leadership Quarterly, 13, 4, pp. 423-451, (2002); Hallinger P., Kantamara P., Exploring the cultural context of school improvement in Thailand, School Effectiveness and School Improvement, 12, 4, pp. 385-408, (2001); Hallinger P., Making education reform happen: Is there an ‘Asian’ way?, School Leadership and Management, 30, 5, pp. 401-418, (2010); Halverson R., Systems of practice: How leaders use artifacts to create professional community in schools, Education Policy Analysis Archives, (2003); Handelzalts A., Nieveen N., Akker J.V.D., Teacher design teams for school-wide curriculum development: Reflections on an early study, Collaborative curriculum design for sustainable innovation and teacher learning, pp. 55-82, (2019); Harris A., What works in school improvement?

The framework was to combine destination personality, self-congruity, uncertainty avoidance, and tourists’ revisit intention. The present conceptual paper proposed an integrated model of self-congruity which incorporates the effect of uncertainty avoidance. More importantly, the uncertainty avoidance was introduced as a moderator between self-congruity and revisit intention. Based on the theoretical framework proposed in this article, the estimated results affirmed the applicability of the theory of self-congruity for tourism research. Moreover, by extending the theoretical model through the incorporation of a variable of uncertainty avoidance in the context of tourism, this article offers a significant contribution to the tourism literature. It is important to understand how the theory of self-congruity applies across a broad cultural spectrum.

Previous research suggests that national culture may exert an independent influence on individuals’ PSM. This article examines PSM as an individual-level variable that is related to national culture, which is represented by Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme (2005), I investigate the relationship between cultural dimensions and individuals’ PSM. This article demonstrates that masculinity and indulgence are positively related to individuals’ PSM, whereas individualism is negatively associated with individuals’ PSM. However, power distance and uncertainty avoidance have a non-significant relationship with PSM. This article provides partial support for the thesis that national culture is associated with individuals’ PSM, but future research is required to explicate the relationship of cultural characteristics to individuals’ PSM. Points for practitioners: Culture influences certain types of behavior both directly and indirectly. The article suggests that cultural tendencies such as masculinity, indulgence, and collectivism have a significant positive influence on individuals’ PSM. Organizational education and socialization enhancing these cultural values are likely to foster employees’ PSM. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","civil service; ethics; human resources management; personnel policies;

Longevity and birth rate data for 59 countries and regions from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s were used. Multiple regression analyses were conducted, adjusted for the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and gender gaps in higher education and workforce participation. Uncertainty avoidance (UA) was positively associated with the percentage of older adults in all three decades and negatively associated with the total fertility rate in the 1990s. Interactions between UA and GDP were significant for the percentage of female older adults in the 1990s and 2000s, male and female life expectancy, and the total fertility rate in the 1990s. UA was positively associated with life expectancy and negatively associated with the total fertility rate in countries with higher GDP, but not in countries with lower GDP. UA may therefore be a key cultural value for aging societies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","Ecological study; GDP; Individualism; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","aged; aging; article; avoidance behavior; birth rate; cultural value; female; fertility; gender; gross national product; human; human experiment; individuality; life expectancy; longevity; male; multiple regression; organization; tertiary education; uncertainty; workforce","Ahn N., Mira P., A note on the changing relationship between fertility and female employment rates in developed countries, Journal of Population Economics, 15, pp. 667-682, (2002); Bailey H., Kind P., Preliminary findings of an investigation into the relationship between national culture and EQ-5D value sets, Quality of Life Research, 19, 8, pp. 1145-1154, (2010); Barro-Lee Estimates of educational attainment for the population aged 15–64 from 1950 to 2015, Barro–Lee Educational Attainment Dataset., (2018); Baskervill R.F., Hofstede never studies culture, Accounting, Organizations and Society, 28, pp. 1-14, (2003); Borg M.A., Cultural determinants of infection control behaviour: Understanding drivers and implementing effective change, Journal of Hospital Infection, 86, 3, pp. 161-168, (2014); Borisova L.V., Martinussen P.E., Rydland H.T., Stornes P., Eikemo T.A., Public evaluation of health services across 21 European countries: The role of culture, Scandinavian Journal of Public Health, 45, 2, pp. 132-139, (2017); Cohen J., Cohen P., West S.G., Aiken L.S., Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, (2003); Eastin M.S., Guinsler N.M., Worried and wired: Effects of health anxiety on information-seeking and health care utilization behaviors, Cyber Psychology & Behavior, 9, 4, pp. 494-498, (2006); Fischer R., Boer D., What is more important for national well-being: Money or autonomy?

This study explores the hypothesis that national culture influences the flexibility of (medical) schools in terms of their propensity to adopt integrated and PBL curricula. Methods: National culture was defined by a country's scores on indexes for 4 dimensions of culture as described by Hofstede, defined as: power distance; individualism/collectivism; masculinity/femininity, and uncertainty avoidance. Non-integrated medical curricula were defined as those that included courses in 2 of the 3 basic sciences (anatomy, biochemistry and physiology) in the first 2 years; otherwise, by exclusion, curricula were assumed to be integrated. The medical curricula of 134 of the 263 schools in the 17 European countries included in Hofstede's study were examined. Results: Correlations were calculated between the percentage of integrated medical curricula in a country and that country's scores on indexes for each of the 4 dimensions of culture. Significant negative correlations were found between the percentage of integrated curricula and scores on the power distance index (correlation coefficient [CC]: - 0.692; P = 0.002) and the uncertainty avoidance index (CC: - 0.704; P = 0.002). No significant correlations were found between the percentage of integrated curricula and scores on the indexes for individualism/collectivism and masculinity/femininity. Conclusions: A (medical) school which is considering adopting an integrated or PBL curriculum and which is based in a country with a high score on Hofstede's power distance index and/or uncertainty avoidance index must a priori design strategies to reduce or overcome the obstructive effects of these dimensions of culture on the school's organisation. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2008.","*problem based learning; Culture; Curriculum; Education, medical/ *organization-&-administration; Europe; Multicenter study [publication type]","Culture; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Europe; Problem-Based Learning; Schools, Medical; article; course content; cultural factor; curriculum; education program; Europe; femininity; human; masculinity; medical education; medical school; problem based learning; quality of life; social status","Dornhorst A.C., Hunter A., Fallacies in medical education, Lancet, 2, pp. 666-7, (1967); Humphreys A., Post T., Ellis A., Interdisciplinary Methods: A Thematic Approach., (1981); Harden R.M., Sowden S., Dunn W.R., Educational strategies in curriculum development: The SPICES model, Med Educ, 18, pp. 284-97, (1984); Papa F.J., Harasym P.H., Medical curriculum reform in North America, 1756 to the present: A cognitive science perspective, Acad Med, 74, pp. 154-64, (1999); Neufeld V.R., Barrows H.S., The 'McMaster philosophy': An approach to medical education, J Med Educ, 49, pp. 1040-50, (1974); Barrows H.S., Tamblyn R.M., Problem-based Learning.

Based on media synchronicity theory (MST), this research examines how cultural differences may influence individuals' assessments of different media capabilities and their relationship to synchronicity. Comparing data collected from 308 respondents in Italy and the US, the different cultural characteristics of uncertainty avoidance and high/low context were examined for their influence on media capabilities identified in MST and their contribution to synchronicity. Results show that for US respondents, four of the five media capabilities have a significant association, while for Italian respondents, only two of the five media capabilities have a significant association. This research suggests that contextual differences based on cultures exist in the way MST operates and that culture should be considered in theorizing with respect to MST.","","Hardware; Communication technologies; Cultural difference; Empirical test; Media synchronicities; Uncertainty avoidance; Information systems","Burgoon J.K., Bonito J.A., Bengtsson B., Ramirez A., Dunbar N.E., Miczo N., Testing the interactivity model: Communication processes, partner assessments, and the quality of collaborative work, Journal of Management Information Systems, 16, 3, pp. 33-56, (1999); Cornelius C., Boos M., Enhancing mutual understanding in synchronous computer-mediated communication by training, Communication Research, 30, 2, pp. 147-177, (2002); Dennis A.R., Fuller R.M., Valacich J.S., Media, tasks, and communication processes: A theory of media synchronicity, MIS Quarterly, 32, 3, pp. 575-600, (2008); Dennis A.R., Valacich J.S., Carte T.A., Garfield M.J., Haley B.J., Aronson J.E., Research report: The effectiveness of multiple dialogues in electronic brainstorming, Information Systems Research, 8, 2, pp. 203-211, (1997); Erickson T., Herring S., Sack W., Discourse architectures: Designing and visualizing computer mediated communication, CHI 2002: Changing the World, Changing Ourselves, (2002); Gudykunst W.B., Matsumoto Y., Ting-Toomey S., Nishida T., Kim K., Heyman S., The influence of cultural individualism-collectivism, self construals, and individual values on communication styles across cultures, Human Communication Research, 22, 4, pp. 510-543, (1996); Hall E.T., Beyond Culture, (1976); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences, (1984); Hofstede G.H., Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions and organizations across nations, Geert Hofstede, (2001); Jia H.Y., Sundar S.S., Lee J.Y., Lee S., Is Web 2.0 culture-free or culture-bound?

Hospitality leaders may need to be emotionally intelligent or self-aware in order to be perceived as effective leaders. This study examines whether self-awareness, one important facet of emotional intelligence relates to perceptions of leadership effectiveness for hospitality leaders taking cultural context into consideration (e.g., uncertainty avoidance, performance orientation, and in-group collectivism). A total of 696 managers at an international organization in the hospitality sector were surveyed and each selected up to 3-5 other individuals to complete a description of their leadership styles of thinking and behaving. Results indicate that self-awareness resulted in increased perceptions of leader effectiveness in all but one of the cultural conditions of this research, even when the quality of the work relationship between leader and others was first taken into account. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Culture; Hospitality managers; Leadership effectiveness; Self-awareness","","Atwater L.E., Brett J.F., 360-degree feedback to leaders: Does it relate to changes in employee attitudes?, Group & Organization Management, 31, 5, pp. 578-600, (2006); Atwater L., Waldman D., Ostroff C., Robie C., Johnson K., Self-other agreement: Comparing its relationship with performance in the US and Europe, International Journal of Selection and Assessment, 13, 1, pp. 25-40, (2005); Atwater L., Wang M., Smither J., Fleenor J., Are cultural characteristics associated with the relationship between self and others' ratings of leadership?, Journal of Applied Psychology, 94, 4, pp. 876-886, (2009); Atwater L., Yammarino F., Does self-other agreement on leadership perceptions moderate the validity of leadership and performance predictions?, Personnel Psychology, 45, pp. 141-164, (1992); Avolio B.J., Bass B.M., Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of analysis: A multi-level framework for examining the diffusion of transformational leadership, Leadership Quarterly, 6, pp. 199-218, (1995); Avolio B., Gardner W., Walumbwa F., May D., Unlocking the mask: A look at the process by which authentic leaders impact follower attitudes and behaviors, Leadership Quarterly, 15, 6, pp. 801-823, (2004); Bar-On R., The Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i): Technical manual, (1997); Barling J., Slater F., Kelloway E.K., Transformational leadership and emotional intelligence: An exploratory study, Leadership & Organizational Development Journal, 21, 3, pp. 157-161, (2000); Bertsch A., Girard J., Cross-cultural differences in social knowledge creation and exchange: An examination of GLOBE's dimensions of societal culture, Interdisciplinary Journal Of Contemporary Research In Business, 3, 4, pp. 15-26, (2011); Bratton V., Dodd N., Brown W., The impact of emotional intelligence on accuracy of self-awareness and leadership performance, Leadership & Organizational Development Journal, 32, 2, pp. 127-149, (2011); Brett J.F., Atwater L.E., 360 feedback: Accuracy, reactions, and perceptions of usefulness, Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 5, pp. 930-942, (2001); Brownell J., Personality and career development: A study of gender differences, The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administrative Quarterly, 35, 2, pp. 36-43, (1994); Ciarrochi J.V., Chan A.Y.C., Caputi P., A critical evaluation of the emotional intelligence construct, Personality and Individual Differences, 28, 3, pp. 539-561, (2000); DeCarlo T., Rody R., DeCarlo J., A cross national example of supervisory management practices in the sales force, The Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management, 19, pp. 1-14, (1999); Diggins C., Emotional intelligence: The key to effective performance, Human Resource Management, 12, 1, pp. 33-35, (2004); Fleenor J., Smither J., Atwater L., Braddy P., Sturm R., Self-other rating agreement in leadership: A review, The Leadership Quarterly, 21, pp. 1005-1034, (2010); Gardner L., Stough C., Examining the relationship between leadership and emotional intelligence in senior level mangers, Leadership & Organizational Development Journal, 23, 2, pp. 68-78, (2002); Gardner W., Avolio B., Luthans F., Walumbwa F., May D., Can you see the real me?""

Conversely, the negative effect of fear of failure on entry is moderated by the cultural practices of institutional collectivism and uncertainty avoidance.

In order to solve wicked problems that are never faced before, IS department needs to use knowledge uncommonly through twisting current knowledge slightly or analogizing from other areas. In addition to understand its impact on performance, this study also explores the antecedents of uncommon knowledge use from a human resource management perspective. Specifically, we hypothesize that uncertainty avoidance culture, communication, shared decision making, team style work design, and human resource policies are critical antecedents of knowledge augmentation and adaptation, which in turns lead to better IS performance. The results show that while knowledge adaptation can be enhanced by uncertainty avoidance culture and communication, knowledge augmentation is a function of shared decisionmaking, use of team, and innovation-based policies. The results serve as guidance for managers to choose needed HRM practices to boost desired uncommon knowledge use style.","Human resource management practices; Information system department; Uncommon knowledge use","Decision making;

The author asked employees from several organizations to indicate how often their organizations use seniority when making decisions about pay raises, promotions, and dismissals. Results indicated that organizations with egalitarian cultures, economically successful organizations, and public-sector organizations use seniority more often in such decisions. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance predicted greater use of seniority. The findings are discussed in light of the potential of seniority to maintain and control conflict inherent in open systems and the aging workforce in Western societies.

The experiment carried out in seven countries (China, Germany, Iran, Norway, Poland, USA, and the Republic of South Africa) showed that in some cultures, smiling individuals may be perceived less favorably than non-smiling individuals. We compared ratings of intelligence made by participants viewing photos of smiling and non-smiling people. The results showed that smiling individuals were perceived as more intelligent in Germany and in China; smiling individuals were perceived as less intelligent than the (same) non-smiling individuals in Iran. We suggest that the obtained effects can be explained by the cultural diversity within the dimension of uncertainty avoidance described in the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness) project by House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, and Gupta. © The Author(s) 2013.","culture; intelligence; smile; social perception; uncertainty avoidance","","Bedford N., Fallon S., McAdam M., Lonely Planet: Destination Poland, (2008); Boski P., Kulturowe Ramy Zachowań Społecznych: Podre{Ogonek}Cznik Psychologii Mie{Ogonek}Dzykulturowej, (2009); Fiske S., Cuddy A., Glick P., Universal dimensions of social cognition: Warmth and competence, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11, pp. 77-83, (2006); Gonzaga G., Keltner D., Londahl E., Smith M., Love and the commitment problem in romantic relations and friendship, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, pp. 247-262, (2001); Hall E., Hall M., Understanding Cultural Differences: Germans, French and Americans, (1990); Hareli S., Hess U., What emotional reactions can tell us about the nature of others: An appraisal perspective on person perception, Cognition & Emotion, 24, pp. 128-140, (2010); Heinrich C., Borkenau P., Deception and deception detection: The role of cross-modal inconsistency, Journal of Personality, 66, pp. 687-712, (1998); Hess U., Beaupre M., Cheung N., The Smile: Forms, Functions, and Consequences, pp. 187-216, (2002); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work Related Values, (1980); House R., Hanges P., Javidan M., Dorfman P., Gupta V., Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Lau S., The effect of smiling on person perception, Journal of Social Psychology, 117, pp. 63-67, (1982); Leung A., Cohen D., Within- and between-culture variation: Individual differences and the cultural logics of honor, face, and dignity cultures, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 10, pp. 507-526, (2011); Oslo, (2010); Maringer M., Krumhuber E., Fischer A., Niedenthal P., Beyond smile dynamics: Mimicry and beliefs in judgments of smiles, Emotion, 11, pp. 181-187, (2011); Matsumoto D., Kudoh T., American-Japanese cultural differences in attributions of personality based on smiles, Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 17, pp. 231-243, (1993); Mehu M., Dunbar R., Naturalistic observations of smiling and laughter in human group interactions, Behaviour, 145, pp. 1747-1780, (2008); Minear M., Park D., A lifespan database of adult facial stimuli, Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, & Computers, 36, pp. 630-633, (2004); Niedenthal P., Mermillod M., Maringer M., Hess U., The simulation of smiles (SIMS) model: A window to general principles in processing facial expression, Brain and Behavioural Sciences, 33, pp. 417-433, (2010); Otta E., Lira B., Delevati N., Cesar O., Pires C., The effect of smiling and of head tilting on person perception, Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied, 128, pp. 323-331, (1994); Palmer M., Simmons K., Communicating intentions through nonverbal behaviors, Human Communication Research, 22, pp. 128-160, (1995); Szarota P., Smile, (2011); Tuk M., Verlegh P., Smidts A., Wigboldus D., Interpersonal relationships moderate the effect of faces on person judgments, European Journal of Social Psychology, 39, pp. 757-767, (2009); Vrticka P., Andersson F., Sander D., Vuilleumier P., Memory for friends and foes, Social Neuroscience, 4, pp. 384-401, (2009); Warner-Soderholm G., Understanding Perceptions of Cultural and Intracultural Societal Practices and Values of Norwegian Managers, (2010); Weisbuch M., Ambady N., Clarke A., Achor S., Weele J., On being consistent: The role of verbal-nonverbal consistency in first impressions, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 32, pp. 261-268, (2010); Wojciszke B., Multiple meanings of behavior: Construing actions in terms of competence and morality, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, pp. 222-232, (1994)","K.

Two ethnic groups of Israeli teachers, Jews and Arabs, were examined. Of the 880 questionnaires that were distributed in 18 schools in northern Israel, 569 usable questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 65%. The findings showed substantial differences between the two groups in the four cultural dimensions and in two commitment forms. Ethnicity and the four cultural values related strongly to in-role performance and organizational OCB. The results showed 16 significant interactions of multiple commitments with ethnicity and with cultural dimensions in relation to OCB and in-role performance. Implications of the findings for research on commitment and culture are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

This chapter encompasses the main definitions of culture and the theoretical assumptions of the impact of culture on creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. © 2016, Springer New York.","Cultural Dimension; Gender Egalitarianism; National Culture; Power Distance; Uncertainty Avoidance","","Amado G., Faucheux C., Laurent A., Organizational change and cultural realities: Franco-American contrasts, International Studies of Management & Organisation, 21, 3, pp. 62-69, (1991); Andrews T.G., Mead R., Cross-Cultural Management: Critical Perspectives on Business and Management, (2009); Archibugi D., Coco A., Measuring technological capabilities at the country level: A survey and a menu for choice, Research Policy, 34, 2, pp. 175-194, (2005); Ardichvili A., Gasparishvili A., Socio-cultural values, internal work culture and leadership styles in four post-communist countries.

Cultural as well as economic influences are assumed to play a role. This paper deals with the influence of cultural attitudes towards uncertainty on the rate of business ownership across 21 OECD countries. First, the concepts of uncertainty and risk are elaborated, as well as their relevance for entrepreneurship. An occupational choice model is introduced to underpin our reasoning at the macro-level. Second, regression analysis using pooled macro data for 1976, 1990 and 2004 and controlling for several economic variables, yields evidence that uncertainty avoidance is positively correlated with the prevalence of business ownership. According to our model, a restrictive climate of large organizations in high uncertainty avoidance countries pushes individuals striving for autonomy towards self-employment. Regressions for these 3 years separately show that in 2004, this positive correlation is no longer found, indicating that a compensating pull of entrepreneurship in countries with low uncertainty avoidance may have gained momentum in recent years. Third, an interaction term between uncertainty avoidance and GDP per capita in the pooled panel regressions shows that the historical negative relationship between GDP per capita and the level of business ownership is substantially weaker for countries with lower uncertainty avoidance. This suggests that rising opportunity costs of self-employment play a less important role in this cultural environment, or are being compensated by increasing entrepreneurial opportunities. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Business ownership; Comparative analysis of economies; Cross country study; Cultural economics; Entrepreneurship; Uncertainty avoidance","","Acs Z.J., Carlson B., Karlsson C., The linkages among entrepreneurship, SMEs and the macroeconomy, Entrepreneurship, small and mediumsized enterprises and the macroeconomy, pp. 3-42, (1999); Acs Z., Arenius P., Hay M., Minniti M., Global entrepreneurship monitor: 2004 executive report, (2004); Audretsch D.B., Keilbach M., Entrepreneurship capital and economic performance, Reg Stud, 38, 8, pp. 949-959, (2004); Audretsch D.B., Thurik A.R., Capitalism and democracy in the 21st century: From the managed to the entrepreneurial economy, J Evol Econ, 10, 1, pp. 17-34, (2000); Audretsch D.B., Thurik A.R., What is new about the new economy: Sources of growth in the managed and entrepreneurial economies, Ind Corp Change, 10, 1, pp. 267-315, (2001); Audretsch D.B., Thurik A.R., A model of the entrepreneurial economy, Int J Entrep Educ, 2, 2, pp. 143-166, (2004); Bais J., van der Hoeven W.H.M., Verhoeven W.H.J., Determinanten van zelfstandig ondernemerschap: Een internationale vergelijking, (1995); Baum J.R., Olian J.D., Erez M., Schnell E.R., Smith K.G., Sims H.P., Scully J.S., Smith K.A., Nationality and work role interactions: A cultural contrast of Israeli and U.S. entrepreneurs' versus managers' needs, J Bus Venturing, 8, pp. 499-512, (1993); Bhide A., How entrepreneurs craft strategies that work, Harvard Bus Rev, 72, 2, pp. 150-161, (1994); Blanchflower D.G., Meyer B.D., A longitudinal analysis of the young self-employed in Australia and the United States, Small Bus Econ, 6, pp. 1-19, (1994); Blanchflower D.G., Oswald A.J., What makes an entrepreneur?, J Labor Econ, 16, 1, pp. 26-60, (1998); Blanchflower D.G., Oswald A., Stutzer A., Latent entrepreneurship across nations, Eur Econ Rev, 45, pp. 680-691, (2001); Blau D., A time series analysis of self-employment, J Polit Econ, 95, pp. 445-467, (1987); Bygrave W.D., Hunt S.A., Global entrepreneurship monitor 2004 financing report, (2005); Carree M., van Stel A., Thurik R., Wennekers S., Economic development and business ownership: An analysis using data of 23 OECD countries in the period 1976-1996, Small Bus Econ, 19, 3, pp. 271-290, (2002); Carree M., Thurik R., Profitability and number of firms: Their dynamic interaction in Dutch retailing, Studies in industrial organization: Market evolution: competition and cooperation, pp. 257-266, (1995); Carree M., Thurik R., The impact of entrepreneurship on economic growth, pp. 437-471, (2003); Chandler Jr A.D., Scale and scope: The dynamics of industrial capitalism, (1990); Chittenden F., Hall G., Hutchinson P., Small firm growth, access to capital markets and financial structure: Review of issues and an empirical investigation, Small Bus Econ, 8, 1, pp. 59-67, (1996); Choi Y.B., Paradigms and conventions: Uncertainty, decision making and entrepreneurship, (1993); Cohen J., Cohen P., Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, (1983); Davidsson P., Researching Entrepreneurship, International Studies in Entrepreneurship, (2004); de Wit G., Models of self-employment in a competitive market, J Econ Surv, 7, pp. 367-397, (1993); Delmar F., Davidsson P., Where do they come from?

However, research in related disciplines points to the influence of national culture on managers' decisions, thereby questioning the culturally universalistic approach. The purpose of this paper is to explore differences in professional service purchasing in different cultural contexts. Based on a survey of large organizations, we analyze how the purchasing process for a specific type of professional services - management consulting services - is organized in two cultural contexts (i.e. Germany and Sweden). The results indicate that organizations in Germany and Sweden differ in the way they approach key aspects of the purchasing process. These differences are discussed in relation to two central cultural dimensions - uncertainty avoidance and masculinity-femininity - in which Germany and Sweden take very different positions. It is proposed that uncertainty avoidance mainly influences the first steps in the purchasing process (specify, select and contract) whereas masculinity-femininity mainly influences the remaining steps (order, expedite and evaluate). The paper contributes to the purchasing and supply management literature by empirically illustrating differences in purchasing practices in different cultural contexts and developing theory-driven propositions for the influence of national culture on the professional service purchasing process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Management consulting services; Masculinity-femininity; National culture; Professional services; Purchasing process; Uncertainty avoidance","","Aguinis H., Werner S., Abbott J.L., Angert C., Park J.H., Kohlhausen D., Customer-centric science: reporting significant research results with rigor, relevance, and practical impact in mind, Organ.

The aim of this paper is to explore the relationships between different cultural dimensions introduced by G. Hofstede (2001, Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, insititutions, and organizations across nations, 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and the capability of initiating innovation measured by the number of patent applications using the sample of European countries at the regional level. As a novel approach, instead of using Hofstede's original index scores, the measures for the cultural dimensions are based on the European Social Survey. We have learned that to be successful in patenting, a region should have power distance, uncertainty avoidance, family-related collectivism (as opposed to friend-related and organisation-related collectivism), and lower than average masculinity. In addition, the negative relationships between these cultural dimensions and patenting are stronger when there is a higher patenting intensity. However, culture alone does not serve as a guarantee for a high level of patenting intensity. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Culture; Europe; Hofstede; Innovation","","Ahuja G., Collaboration networks, structural holes, and innovation: A longitudinal study, Administrative Science Quarterly, 45, pp. 425-455, (2000); Chanchani S., Theivanathampillai P., Typologies of Culture, (2002); Dakhli M., de Clercq D., Human capital, social capital, and innovation: A multi-country study, Entrepreneurship and Regional Development, 16, pp. 107-128, (2004); Nomenclature of Territorial Units For Statistics - NUTS Statistical Regions of Europe, (2007); Regio, (2007); Patent Classifications and Technology Areas, (2007); Fagerberg J., A technology gap approach to why growth rates differ, Research Policy, 16, pp. 87-99, (1987); Freeman C., Soete L., The Economics of Industrial Innovation, (1997); Glynn M.A., Innovative genius: A framework for relating individual and organizational intelligences to innovation, Academy of Management Review, 21, 4, pp. 1081-111, (1996); Gooderham P., Nordhaug O., Are cultural differences in Europe on the decline?, European Business Forum, 8, pp. 48-53, (2002); Gregersen B., Johnson B., How Do Innovations Affect Economic Growth?

This behavior also guides individuals towards opting between doing job or starting a personal business. Little work has been done so far to examine the effects of national culture on entrepreneurial intentions of citizens in the same country. This study fills this gap by examining the effects of Hofstede (1984) national culture's dimensions on entrepreneurial intentions of individual's for the case of Pakistan. The culture dimensions included; power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, collectivism, long/short term orientation. The data has been collected from employees working in various organizations of Pakistan. Structural equation modeling technique has been adopted to analyze the data and to interpret the results. The study found that cultural dimensions including; higher power distance, collectivism, masculinity and short term orientation are having negative effects on organizational performance for the case of Pakistan. The study has discussed the important implications of national culture's dimensions to improve the organizational performance.","Entrepreneurial intentions; Pakistan; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","Information management; Cultural dimensions; Entrepreneurial intentions; Organizational performance; Pakistan; Personal business; Power distances; Structural equation modeling techniques; Uncertainty avoidance; Knowledge management","Adler N.J., International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, (1991); Ali I., Tajddini K., Rehman K.U., Ali J.F., Ahmed A., University Student's Inclination towards Governance and its Impact on Entrepreneurial Intentions, (2010); Baumol W.J., Entrepreneurship and a Century of Growth, Journal of Business Venturing, 1, pp. 141-145, (1986); Begley T.M., Boyd D.P., Psychological Characteristics Associated with Performance in Entrepreneurial Firms and Smaller Businesses, Journal of Business Venturing, 2, pp. 79-93, (1987); Birch D.L., The Job Generation Process, M.I.T, (1979); Birley S., The role of New Firms: Births, Deaths and Job Generation, Strategic Management Journal, 7, pp. 361-376, (1986); Boyacigiller N.A., Adler N.J., The Parochial Dinosaur: Organizational Science in a Global Context, Academy of Management Review, 16, pp. 262-290, (1991); Byrne B.M., Structural Equation Modeling with AMOS: Basic concepts, application, and programming, (2001); Carland J.W., Hoy F., Carland J.C., Who is an Entrepreneur? is a question worth asking, American Journal of Small Business, 12, 4, pp. 33-39, (1988); Carland J.W., Hoy F., Boulton W.R., Carland J.C., Differentiating Entrepreneurs from Small Business Owners.

The study surveyed both engineers and engineering managers about their knowledge sharing behaviors and organizational commitment. The results of the study, while statistically significant and sufficient to satisfy the requirements of a doctor of philosophy degree program, demonstrated only weak to moderate relationships between the response variables. Chapter six of the study was created by suggesting a reason for the relatively weak study results and then supporting that suggestion with multiple studies from the literature. The construct of uncertainty avoidance within the organizational culture of engineering was introduced in chapter six and is discussed as a potential reason for the study's results.

We propose a theoretical framework that links CEO risk tolerance to the expected net synergies. We empirically show that CEOs of firms located in countries with lower levels of risk tolerance, measured by Hofstede's (1980, 2001) uncertainty avoidance score, require higher premiums on takeovers, and show that uncertainty avoidance plays a greater role in relatively large takeovers. Additional testing reveals that CEOs from high uncertainty avoiding nations engage less in cross-border/cross-industry takeovers, suggesting that uncertainty avoidance captures more the CEO's risk perception than his/her risk aversion. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Financial decision making; Risk tolerance; Synergies; Takeovers; Uncertainty avoidance","","Aggarwal R., Goodell J., Financial markets versus institutions in European countries: influence of culture and other national characteristics, International Business Review, 19, pp. 502-520, (2010); Ahern K., Daminelli D., Fracassi C., forthcoming.

The influence of culture on metacognitive strategies is a relatively new topic. Using Antonietti's, Ignazi's and Perego's questionnaire on metacognitive knowledge about problem-solving strategies (2000), five strategies in three life domains were assessed among student samples in Brazil, India, and the United States (N=317), regarding the frequency, facility, and efficacy of these strategies. To investigate cross-cultural similarities and differences in strategy use, nationality and uncertainty avoidance values were independent variables. Uncertainty avoidance was expected to lead to high frequency of decision strategies. However, results showed no effect of uncertainty avoidance on frequency, but an effect on facility of metacognitive strategies. Comparing the three cultural samples, all rated analogy as the most frequent strategy. Only in the U.S. sample, analogy was also rated as the most effective and easy to apply strategy. Every cultural group showed a different preference regarding what metacognitive strategy was most effective. Indian participants found the free production strategy to be more effective, and Indian and Brazilian participants found the combination strategy to be more effective compared to the U.S. participants. As key abilities for the five strategies, Indians rated speed, Brazilians rated synthesis, and U.S. participants rated critical thinking as more important than the other participants. These results reflect the embedded nature and functionality of problem-solving strategies in specific cultural environments.

However, by focusing on the competitive environment in which companies operate, it abstracts from the cultural context in which governance decisions are made. We study the cultural boundedness of TCE using two seminal cultural theories: the political science/sociology framework of Inglehart and the management science framework of Hofstede. We use these theories to develop (main-effect) hypotheses about the cultural contexts in which TCE has higher predictive power as well as (interaction) hypotheses regarding particular cultural contexts that may inherently be more inclined than others to adopt certain non-market governance modes if the market ""fails."" Hypotheses are tested using a meta-analysis on data collected from 128 studies from 12 countries on 3 continents, representing governance decisions of 60,926 companies. We find that TCE is a universal theory across all cultural contexts. This being said, we find that in societies low on power distance and in societies characterized by a strong emphasis on secular-rational and self-expression values, companies are more strongly guided in their governance decisions by economic, transaction-cost considerations than companies in societies high on power distance and in countries that are characterized by traditional and survival values. Further, TCE's power to predict the specific type of non-market governance employed by the firm is systematically moderated by the national culture in which the firm operates. The power of TCE for predicting hierarchical governance is higher in countries that rate high on secular-rational values and on uncertainty avoidance and low on long-term orientation, whereas TCE is more diagnostic for predicting relational governance in countries high on self-expression values and low on power distance and on uncertainty avoidance. In sum, our meta-analysis provides support for our thesis that to fully understand governance choices made by firms, we need to integrate TCE and cultural theory. While managers around the world are guided by economic considerations, the cultural context in which they operate exerts a substantial-and predictable-contingent effect on their governance choices. © 2011 Academy of Marketing Science.","Competition;

As mentioned in Chap. 1, Japanese managers transplant their management practices to Thailand. However, conflicts in Japanese manufacturing organizations occur when the Japanese management practices which work well in Japan, are not appropriate to the Thai culture. Implicit in this assumption is the notion that failing to adapt Japanese management practices in Thailand decreases the motivation and performance of Thai subordinates, and hence decreases business efficiency. This is followed by a discussion on how these concepts and gaps within the management literature have been used to formulate the proposed research questions for the present book. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavioral Intention; Change Process; Monetary Reward; Motivational Factor; Uncertainty Avoidance","","","T.

In analyzing these two issues we controlled for key organizational characteristics (size, technological level, sector, service and globalization level). Data from 5,991 organizations in 21 countries were obtained for this study, using the database of CRANET (Cross-country HRM research). Data on cultural values were taken from the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness) study and assigned to the organizations respectively. Results showed that national values explained PA strategies, confirming all related study hypotheses. Generally, values such as power distance, future orientation, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism explained the use of different PA systems. Organizational characteristics were also related to PA. In addition, we found interactions between national values and PA programs on organizational outcomes that supported the study's hypotheses. The results have strong implications for organizations operating in different cultures on how to maximize the fit between a particular culture and PA strategies in order to enhance organizational performance.","National values; Organizational outcomes; Performance appraisal","National values; Organizational characteristics; Organizational effectiveness; Organizational outcomes; Organizational performance; Organizational performance indicators; Performance appraisal; Uncertainty avoidance; Public address systems","Aycan Z., The interplay between cultural and institutional/structural contingencies in human resource management practices, International Journal of Human Resource Management, 16, 7, pp. 1083-1119, (2005); Aycan Z., Kanungo R.N., Mendonca M., Yu K., Deller J., Stahl G., Kurshid A., Impact of culture on human resource management practices: A 10-country comparison, Applied Psychology: An International Review, 49, 1, pp. 192-221, (2000); Brown M., Managing the overload?, Group & Organization Management, 30, 1, pp. 99-124, (2005); Bryk A.S., Raudenbush S.W., Hierarchical Linear Models, Applications and Data Analysis Methods, (1992); Fischer R., Ferreira M.C., Assmar E.M.L., Redford P., Harb C., Organizational behavior across cultures: Theoretical and methodological issues for developing multi-level frameworks involving culture, International Journal of Cross Cultural Management, 5, 1, pp. 27-48, (2005); Fried Y., Levi A.S., Ben-David H.A., Tiegs R., Avital N., Rater positive and negative mood predispositions as predictors of performance ratings of ratees in simulated and real organizational settings: Evidence from U.S. and Israeli samples, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 73, pp. 373-378, (2000); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-related Values, (1980); Hofstede G., Peterson M.F., Culture: National values and organizational practices, Handbook of Organizational Culture and Climate, (2000); House R., Hanges P., Javidan M., Dorfman P., Gupta V., Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Kanungo R.N., Jaeger A.M., Introduction: The need for indigenous management in developing countries, Management in Developing Countries, (1990); Kim S., Globalization of human resource management: A cross-cultural perspective for the public sector, Public Personnel Management, 28, 2, pp. 227-243, (1999); Mero N.P., Guidice R.M., Anna L.A., The interacting effects of accountability and individual differences on rater response to a performance-rating task, Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 36, pp. 795-819, (2006); Murphy K.R., Cleveland J.N., Performance Appraisal: An Organizational Perspective, (1995); Schwartz S.H., A theory of cultural values and some implications for work, Applied Psychology, 48, 1, pp. 23-47, (1999); Vallance S., Performance appraisal in Singapore, Thailand and Philippines: A cultural perspective, Australian Journal of Public Administration, 58, pp. 78-86, (1999)","H.

We use an index based on Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and categorize countries according to their socio-economic conditions and cultural, legal and corporate systems. The sample is composed of 1598 international companies from twenty countries for the years 2004-2010. By controlling for companies' activities, size, profitability and growth opportunities, we observe that normative and regulative institutional structures have an important impact on corporate transparency. Concretely, firms located in coercive societies, characterized by higher long-term orientation, higher cultural values of collectivist, feminist and uncertainty avoidance and a lower power distance index, are more sensitive to publishing corporate social responsibility reports. Moreover, our analysis suggests the characteristics of the country's system, such as its civil law legal environment, strong law enforcement and ownership concentration, are key elements in the disclosure of relevant and comparable information for stakeholders' decision-making processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental regulations; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Decision making process; Global Reporting Initiative; Institutional structure; International company; Long-term orientation; Socio-economic conditions; Uncertainty avoidance; corporate strategy; decision making; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; voluntary approach; Societies and institutions","Adams C.A., Kuasirikun N., A comparative analysis of corporate reporting on ethical issues by UK and German chemical and pharmaceutical companies, European Accounting Review, 9, 1, pp. 53-80, (2000); Adams C.A., Internal organisational factors influencing corporatesocial and ethical reporting.

The proposition merits investigation because it has important implications for local as well as international and global companies. The study first investigates employees' perceptions of the existing and preferred cultural orientations in four Jordanian organizations, and then it compares the results with other studies conducted in other cultures (American and South African). In Jordan data were collected by means of Harrison and Stokes survey for diagnosing organizational culture, the same instrument used in the USA and in South Africa. The study concludes by suggesting that in certain countries the national culture's effects may appear in a particular dominant organizational culture, that is desired by the management, but not actually preferred by employees. This implies that it is more beneficial for international and transnational corporations to develop ""strong"" cultures rather than to encourage local units to adapt to their national cultures. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Five groups of Israeli teachers who were assumed to represent different cultural groups (secular Jews, orthodox Jews, kibbutz teachers, Druze, and Arabs) were examined. The findings showed substantial differences among the five groups in the four cultural values. Both membership in a cultural group, measured as a dummy variable, and cultural values were associated with OCB and in-role performance in addition to the effect of multiple commitments. The results also showed that organizational commitment and group commitment were related to forms of OCB more than to the other commitment foci.

Design/methodology/ approach - Two questionnaires adopted from the GLOBE project and OCAI were used to collect quantitative data on national and organisational culture. Also, a face to face semi-structured interview was used to get insight into deep-rooted issues concerning information security in the study environment. In addition, a previous study was used to find correlation of the data in this study. Findings - The findings show that national culture has more influence than organisation culture on information security. We find that the dimensions that influence information security are Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, In-Group Collectivism, and Future Orientation. Research limitations/implications - This research was conducted in a public sector environment with employees thereby limiting external validity. Also, the population of the survey was small to make a generalisation of the findings. Also, the length of the questionnaire and complexity of questions put off many potential respondents. Practical implications - Culture has impact on information security implementation and therefore the results imply that some consideration should be given when implementing information security models. Originality/value - This study is important because it empirically correlates information security with cultural dimensions in a developing country's environment.

Equity alliances provide supporting mechanisms that quell fears about organizational risk in alliances under conditions of uncertainty avoidance as the dominant cultural-cognitive frame, and hence contribute to better innovation performance. Contractual alliances are associated with higher levels of innovation under normative contexts that value collectivism rather than individualism. •Contrary to expectation, the results do not support the literature of a fit between equity alliances and weak intellectual property rights protection on innovation. However, the presence of highly formalized legal processes for enforcing contracts is associated with higher levels of innovation from alliances. © 2011 Gabler Verlag.","Alliance portfolio; Culture; Innovation; Institutions; Legal systems; Multilevel model","","Almeida P., Knowledge sourcing by foreign multinationals: Patent citation analysis in the U.S. semiconductor industry, Strategic Management Journal, 17, Winter, pp. 155-165, (1996); Ambos B., Schlegelmilch B.B., Innovation in multinational firms: Does cultural fit enhance performance?, Management International Review, 48, 2, pp. 189-206, (2008); Anand B.N., Khanna T., The structure of licensing contracts, The Journal of Industrial Economics, 48, 1, pp. 103-135, (2000); Beise M., Lead markets: country-specific drivers of the global diffusion of innovations, Research Policy, 33, 6-7, pp. 997-1018, (2004); Belsley D.A., Conditioning Diagnostics: Collinearity and Weak Data in Regression, (1991); Boylaud O., Nicoletti G., Regulation, market structure and performance in telecommunications, (2000); Boyle E.H., Is law the rule?

In particular, three groups of factors have been investigated: trust literature, diffusion of innovation theory, and national culture, in order to reveal their effect on forming a customer's initial trust in IBS. We collected data using a survey and then analysed it using structural equation modelling. According to the obtained results, initial trust in internet banking services was significantly affected by: (i) factors obtained from the trust literature, which are disposition to trust, organisational structural assurance, and reputation. (ii) Relative advantages, which was adopted from the diffusion of innovation theory. (iii) Uncertainty avoidance, which is a dimension of national culture. Also, analysis of results showed a high impact of initial trust in IBS on the intention to use it. However, unlike developed countries, we found that some factors not to have noticeable influence on initial trust in IBS, such as: technical structural assurance and individualism versus collectivism.","Developing countries; Initial trust; Intention to use; Internet banking; National culture","Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Information systems; Innovation; Management information systems; Diffusion of innovation theory; Disposition to trusts; Initial trusts; Intention to use; Internet banking; National cultures; Structural equation modelling; Uncertainty avoidance; Web services","Al-Hujran O., Al-Dalahmeh M., Aloudat A., The role of national culture on citizen adoption of E-Government services: An empirical study, Electronic Journal of E-Government, 9, 2, pp. 93-106, (2011); Al-Jaafreh A., Gill A., Al-Ani A., Al-Adaileh R., A review of literature of initial trust in E-services: The case of internet banking services in the jordanian context, Journal of Electronic Banking Systems, (2014); Al-Sukkar A., Hasan H., Toward a model for the acceptance of internet banking in developing countries, Information Technology for Development, 11, 4, pp. 381-398, (2005); Aladwani A.M., Key internet characteristics and E-commerce issues in arab countries, Information Technology & People, 16, 1, pp. 9-20, (2003); Aljaafreh A., Al-Ani A., Conceptualizing Initial Trust in Internet Banking Services: A Pilot Study.

The results show that the cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, masculinity-femininity, and individualism-collectivism have statistically significant relationships to sanitation technology choice. These data prove the global impact of culture on infrastructure choice, and reemphasize that local cultural preferences must be considered when constructing sanitation infrastructure. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","Choice Behavior; Culture; Female; Humans; Internationality; Male; Regression Analysis; Sanitation; Uncertainty; Sewers; Case study research; Cultural dimensions; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Individualism collectivisms; Infrastructure development; On-site sanitations; Sewerage treatment; Uncertainty avoidance; cultural influence; developing world; global perspective; infrastructural development; research work; sanitation; sewage treatment; sewer network; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; avoidance behavior; behavior; collectivism; conceptual framework; controlled study; cultural anthropology; cultural value; engineering and technology; femininity; gross national product; Hofstede cultural dimension framework; human; individuality; masculinity; sanitation; sanitation infrastructure; social evolution; uncertainty avoidance; urban population; decision making; female; international cooperation; male; regression analysis; uncertainty; Sanitation","(2012); Progress on Sanitation and Drinking-Water: 2013 Update, (2013); Onda K., Lobuglio J., Bartram J., Global access to safe water: Accounting for water quality and the resulting impact on MDG progress, Int.

Drawing on patent data of enterprises with international businesses in Beijing, this paper verified the theoretical model and research hypotheses by using structural equation model, and analyzed the mechanism and the path of uncertainty avoidance impact on management innovation. The results show that uncertainty avoidance can not directly affect the management innovation, but can affect it indirectly through organizational culture. We also find that the external adaptation value and internal integration value of organizational culture play key intermediary roles in the influence relationship between uncertainty avoidance and management innovation. ©2012 IEEE.","Management innovation; Organizational culture; Uncertainty avoidance","Behavioral research; Industrial engineering; Information management; Innovation; Cross-cultural research; International business; Management innovation; Organizational cultures; Structural equation models; Theoretical models; Uncertainty avoidance; Uncertainty analysis","Hofstede G., Culture and Organizations: Software of the Mind, (1991); Stata R., Organizational learning-The key to management innovation, Sloan Management Review, 30, 3, pp. 63-74, (1989); Benghozi P.J., Managing innovation: From ad hoc to routine in french telecom, Organization Studies, 11, 4, pp. 531-554, (1990); Hargrave T.J., Van De Ven Anderew, A collective action model of institutional innovation, Academy of Management Review, 31, pp. 864-888, (2006); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-Related Values, (1980); Frank K.A., Fahrbach K., Organization culture as a complex system: Balance and information in models of influence and selection, Organization Science, 10, 3, pp. 253-277, (1999); Schein E.H., Culture: The Missing Concept in Organization Studies, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, 2, pp. 229-240, (1996); Zheng B., Organization culture: Concept and measurement, Journal of Psychology, 32, (1990); Hamel G., The Why, What and How of Manage-ment Innovation, Harvard Business Review, 84, 2, pp. 72-84, (2006); Shane S., Cultural influences on national rates of innovation, Journal of Business Venturing, 8, 1, pp. 59-73, (1993); Hoffman R.C., Organizational Innovation: Management Influence AcrossCultures, Multinational Business Review, 7, pp. 37-49, (1999); Ang S.H., Hong D.G., Entrepreneurial Spirit a East Asian Chinese, Thunderbird International Business Review, 42, 3, pp. 285-309, (2000); Everdingen Y.M.V., Waarts E., The Effect of national culture on the adoption of innovations, Marketing Letters, 14, 3, pp. 217-232, (2003); Jaeger A.M., Organizational development and national culture: Where's the fit?, The Academy of Management Review, 11, 1, pp. 178-190, (1986); Couto J.P., Vieiva J.A., National culture and research and development activities, Multinational Business Review, (2004); Barker J., The Discipline of Teamwork: Participation and Concertive Control, (1999); Knighs D., Mccabe D., Ain't Misbehaving?

Even though uncertainty almost always exists in decision making contexts, individuals and cultures vary in their preference for avoiding uncertainty. This study examines how uncertainty avoidance influences judgments involving uncertain and risky alternatives. Participants were presented with problems that involve potential gains or losses and contain options reflecting uncertain or certain outcomes. Greater uncertainty avoidance predicted choices for uncertain outcomes that involved gains, which tend to promote risk aversion, but not for uncertain outcomes that led to losses, which tend to promote risk seeking. These results demonstrate that culturally-relevant dispositions such as uncertain avoidance can have complex effects on judgment. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Gain and loss framed decisions; Uncertainty avoidance","","Grecko V., Roger D., Coping with uncertainty: The construction and validation of a new measure, Personality and Individual Differences, 31, pp. 519-534, (2001); Hastie R., Dawes R.M., Rational Choice in an Uncertain World: The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making, (2001); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences, (1980); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences, (2001); Hong Y., Benet-martinez V., Chiu C., Morris M.W., Boundaries of cultural influence: Construct activation as a mechanism for cultural differences in social perception, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 34, pp. 453-464, (2003); Javidan M., House R.J., Dorfman P.W., A nontechnical summary of GLOBE findings, Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, pp. 39-48, (2004); Kahneman D., Tversky A., Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk, Econometrica, 47, pp. 263-291, (1979); Kahneman D., Tversky A., Choices, values, and frames, American Psychologist, 39, pp. 341-350, (1984); Kemelmeier M., Cheng B.Y., Language and self-construal priming: A replication and extension in a Hong Kong sample, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, pp. 705-712, (2004); Lau L., Ranyard R., Chinese and English probabilistic thinking and risk taking in gambling, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 36, pp. 621-627, (2005); Lejuez C.W., Read J.P., Kahler C.W., Richards J.B., Ramsey S.E., Stuart G.L., Et al., Evaluation of a behavioral measure of risk taking: The balloon analogue risk task (BART), Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, pp. 75-84, (2002); Markus H.R., Hamedani M.G., Sociocultural psychology: The dynamic interdependence among self systems and social systems, Handbook of Cultural Psychology, pp. 3-39, (2007); Matsumoto D., Yoo S.H., Toward a new generation of cross-cultural research, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 1, pp. 234-250, (2006); Miyamoto Y., Nisbett R.E., Masuda T., Culture and the physical environment: Holistic versus analytical perceptual affordances, Psychological Science, 17, pp. 113-119, (2006); Nisbett R., The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why, (2003); Plous S., The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making, (1993); Slovic P., Fischhoff B., Lichtenstein S., Response mode, faming, and information-processing effects in risk assessment, New Directions for Methodology of Social and Behavioral Science: Question Framing and Response Consistency (No. 11), (1982); Sorrentino R.M., Smithson M., Hodson G., Roney C.J.R., Walker A.M., The theory of uncertainty orientation: A mathematical reformulation, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 47, pp. 132-149, (2003); Triandis H.C., Individualism and collectivism: Past, present, and future, The Handbook of Culture and Psychology, (2001); Tversky A., Kahneman D., The framing of decisions and the psychology of choice, Science, 211, pp. 453-458, (1981)","J.

Experiential learning theory is used to describe the learning process and the Kolb Learning Style Inventory is used to assess differences in how individuals learn. Using the framework for categorizing cultural differences from the Global Leadership and Organizational Effectiveness (GLOBE) study, national cultures are examined by cultural clusters and individual cultural dimensions. The first part of the study assesses the relative influence of culture in comparison to gender, age, level of education and area of specialization of 533 respondents born in and currently residing in 7 nations. We found that a significant portion of the variance in the preference for abstract conceptualization was explained by culture, gender, level of education and area of specialization. The variability in preference for active experimentation over reflective observation was accounted for by age and area of specialization. The impact of culture was only marginally significant. In the second part of the study where we examined the influence of individual culture dimensions in shaping the learning style preferences, we discovered that individuals tend to have a more abstract learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, institutional collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, future orientation and gender egalitarianism. Individuals may have a more reflective learning style in countries that are high in in-group collectivism, uncertainty avoidance and assertiveness. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty avoidance is one of Hofstede's five cultural dimensions. The paper presents a model of how this dimension affects trade. This influence has been explicated for the decisions regarding trade: partner selection, negotiation behavior, trust, and the interpretation of the trade partner's behavior. It has been verified in simulations showing that the generic tendencies as attributed to uncertainty avoidance are reflected in the simulation results. Our approach is an example of instantiating generic knowledge on the influences of culture on decision-making in general.","Agents; Culture; Negotiation; Trade; Uncertainty avoidance","Decision making; Simulators; Cultural attitudes; Cultural dimensions; Culture; Negotiation; Partner selection; Simulation result; Trade; Trade partners; Uncertainty avoidance; Commerce","Bala V., Long N.V., International trade and cultural diversity with preference selection, European Journal of Political Economy, 21, pp. 143-162, (2005); Bosse T., Jonker C.M., Treur J., Experiments in Human Multi-Issue Negotiation: Analysis and Support, Proc. of the Third International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, AAMAS'04, pp. 672-679, (2004); Brazier F.M.T., Jonker C.M., Treur J., Principles of Component-Based Design of Intelligent Agents, Data and Knowledge Engineering, 41, pp. 1-28, (2002); Trust and Risk in Business Networks, Proc. of the 99th European Seminar of the EAAE, (2006); Gelfand M.J., Brett J.M., The Handbook of Negotiation and Culture, (2004); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences, (2001); Hofstede G., Hofstede G.J., Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, (2005); Hofstede G.J., Jonker C.M., Meijer S., Verwaart T., Modeling Trade and Trust across Cultures, LNCS, 3986, pp. 120-134, (2006); Hofstede G., McCrae R.R., Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture, Cross-Cultural Research, 38, pp. 52-88, (2004); Jonker C.M., Treur J., An Agent Architecture for Multi-Attribute Negotiation, Proc. of the 17th International Joint Conference on AI, IJCAI '01, pp. 1195-2001, (2001); Kinsey J., The New Food Economy: Consumers, Farms, Pharms and Science, American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 83, pp. 1113-1130, (2001); Konya I., Modeling Cultural Barriers in International Trade, Review of International Economics, 14, 3, pp. 494-507, (2006); Lazzarini S.G., Chaddad F.R., Cook M.L., Integrating supply chain and network analyses: The study of netchains, Journal on Chain and Network Science, 1, pp. 7-22, (2001); Meijer S., Hofstede G.J., Beers G., Omta S.W.F., Trust and Tracing game: Learning about transactions and embeddedness in a trade network, Production Planning and Control, 17, pp. 569-583, (2006); Tesfatsion L., Judd K.L., Handbook of Computational Economics Volume 2 Agent-based Computational Economics, (2006); Trompenaars F., Riding the waves of culture: Understanding cultural diversity in business, (1993)","G.

In such situations, the knowledge worker may need to use discretion in deciding whether to use formal or informal knowledge source, particularly when faced with equivocal knowledge from the two sources. We formulate testable theoretical propositions to explain the influence of cultural traits of the knowledge worker such as Individualism-Collectivism, Power Distance and Uncertainty Avoidance on choice of the source in such situations. An experiment is designed to investigate how knowledge source would affect perceptions about knowledge usability to knowledge workers from different national cultures. This study would provide knowledge management researchers and practitioners with insights on how culture affects the value of knowledge from different sources through the use of Internet-based technologies.","Individualism/ collectivism; Knowledge management; Knowledge source; National culture; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","Information systems; Internet; Individualism/ collectivism; Knowledge sources; National cultures; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance; Knowledge management","Alavi M., Tiwana A., Knowledge integration in virtual teams: The potential role of KMS, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 53, 12, pp. 1029-1037, (2002); Argote L., McEvily B., Reagans R., Managing knowledge in organizations: An integrative framework and review of emerging themes, Management Science, 49, 4, pp. 571-582, (2003); Bhushan L., Amal S.B., A situational test of intolerance of ambiguity, Psychologia: An International Journal of Psychology in the Orient, 29, 4, pp. 254-261, (1986); Bock G.-W., Zmud R.W., Kim Y.-G., Lee J.-N., Behavioral intention formation in knowledge sharing: Examining the roles of extrinsic motivators, social-psychological forces, and organizational climate, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 29, 1, pp. 87-111, (2005); Brewer M.B., Ingroup bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive- motivational analysis, Psychological Bulletin, 86, 2, pp. 307-324, (1979); Budner S., Intolerance of ambiguity as a personality variable, Journal of Personality, 30, pp. 29-50, (1962); Chen A.N.K., Edgington T.M., Assessing value in organizational knowledge creation: Considerations for knowledge workers, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 29, 2, pp. 279-309, (2005); Cohen D., Nisbett R.E., Bowdle B.F., Schwarz N., Insult, aggression, and the Sourthern culture of honor: An experimental ethnography, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, pp. 945-960, (1996); Cohen R., Negotiating across Cultures, (1991); Cross R., Sproull L., More than an answer: Information relationships for actionable knowledge, Organization Science, 15, 4, pp. 446-462, (2004); Doney P.M., Cannon J.P., Mullen M.R., Understanding the influence of national culture on the development of trust, Academy of Management Review, 23, 3, pp. 601-620, (1998); Garud R., Kumaraswamy A., Vicious and virtuous circles in the management of knowledge: The case of Infosys Technologies, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 29, 1, pp. 9-33, (2005); Gray P.H., Meister D.B., Knowledge sourcing effectiveness, Management Science, 50, 6, pp. 821-834, (2004); Grimm S.D., Church A.T., Katigbak M.S., Reyes J.A., Self-described traits, values, and moods associated with individualism and collectivism: Testing I-C theory in an indvidualistic (U.S.) and a collectivistic (Philippine) culture, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 30, pp. 466-500, (1999); Gudykunst W.B., Gao G., Schmidt K.L., Nishida T., Bond M.H., Leung K., Wang G., Barraclough R.A., The influence of individualism-collectivism, self-monitoring, and predicted-outcome value on communication in in-group and out-group relationships, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 23, pp. 196-213, (1992); Hansen M., The search-transfer problem: The role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organizational subunits, Administrative Science Quarterly, 44, pp. 82-111, (1999); Harvey N., Harries C., Fischer I., Using advice and assessing its quality, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 81, 2, pp. 252-273, (2000); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences, (2001); Holsapple C.W., Joshi K.D., A formal knowledge management ontology: Conduct, activities, resources, and influences, Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55, 7, pp. 593-612, (2004); Holtgraves T., Styles of language use: Individual and cultural variability in conversational indirectness, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, pp. 624-637, (1997); House R., Javidan M., Hanges P., Dorfman P., Understanding cultures and implicit leadership theories across the globe: An introduction to project GLOBE, Journal of World Business, 37, 1, pp. 3-10, (2002); Iyengar S.S., Lepper M.R., Ross L., Independence from whom?

Psychological empowerment has been portrayed as holding the key to unleashing individual potential for performance improvement in project settings, yet individuals with values at variance with the principles of empowerment may not be suitable candidates. The relationship between seven factors related to an individual's cultural values, status, and quality of relationships and psychological empowerment are explored with a sample of project management-level staff in Hong Kong using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). Results indicate that individual-level factors matter in psychological empowerment experiences in project settings. In particular, culture may be a key boundary condition in making the implementation of empowerment acceptable and effective in different contexts - although the specific influence of cultural values such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and collectivism/individualism still requires further research to confirm. Building quality relationships between leaders and subordinates, and between subordinates themselves, emerges as a viable root to enhancing psychological empowerment on projects. The study supports findings from cross-cultural studies that show differences in empowerment effects across cultures, and so casts doubts on the convergence hypothesis of management practices across cultures. Building robust social support systems may, however, be fundamental to the successful implementation of empowerment in high power distance and high uncertainty avoidance contexts such as that of Hong Kong and China. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Cultural values; Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM); Psychological empowerment; Quality of relationships; Status","Project management; Convergence hypothesis; Cultural value; Hierarchical linear models; Management practices; Organizational behavior; Psychological empowerments; Status; Uncertainty avoidance; Human resource management","Anvuur A.M., Cooperation in Construction Projects: Concept, Antecedents and Strategies, (2008); Armstrong J.S., Overton T.S., Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys, J.

Past dependency is presented in the framework of developments in various areas and this chapter provides an overview of main trends in three periods: Soviet, post-Soviet, and European Union era in Estonia. Main trends are analyzed in the framework of Amabile’s modified model of creativity. This approach gives possibility to differentiate between individual and organizational level processes, whereby individual is seen as gateway to innovation and organizational level is considered to be for the assimilation of influences. Research is based on the analysis of relevant literature, and mind mapping is used to identify the factors and their potential influence. As the result of analysis three models are proposed. These aggregate the comparison of periods on one hand, on the other, impacts from culture, education, economic, and political issues on creativity and learning. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Creative Thinking; Human Resource Management Practice; Organizational Level; Path Dependency; Uncertainty Avoidance","","Rugged LV Trench IGBT with Extreme Stability in Continuous SOA Operation: Next Generation LV Technology at Hitachi ABB Powergrids, PCIM Europe Digital Days 2021; Alakula K., Kalurikolhoos Kirovist AS Esmarini.

The factors influencing e-health adoption have been a well-investigated research area in both developed and developing countries. However, there have been only a few studies exploring the role of cultural factors in the adoption and use of e-health, particularly in developing countries. In this study, we investigated the influence of culture on the adoption of e-health in Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: This study developed a more adequate research framework by integrating Hofstede's cultural dimension model and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from respondents in different private and public hospitals in Bangladesh. The partial least squares method, a statistical analysis technique based on the Structural Equation Model, was used to analyze the collected data. Results: The study found that cultural dimensions such as Power Distance, Masculinity, and Restraint had significant impacts on Intention to Use e-Health, whereas Uncertainty Avoidance, Collectivism, and Pragmatism had no significant impact on Intention to Use e-Health in Bangladesh. The results also revealed that Perceived Usefulness was a significant indicator of e-health adoption decisions, whereas Perceived Ease of Use was an insignificant predictor of e-health adoption. Conclusions: The findings of this study may assist governments, organizations, and policy makers to understand the key factors affecting e-health adoption and to develop strategies and policies to enhance e-health services in Bangladesh. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.","culture; e-Health; Technology Acceptance Model","Adult; Attitude to Computers; Bangladesh; Cultural Characteristics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Cell culture; Developing countries; Hospitals; Least squares approximations; Cultural influences; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Partial least-squares method; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Structural equation modeling; Technology acceptance model; Uncertainty avoidance; adult; attitude to computers; Bangladesh; cultural factor; female; human; male; middle aged; questionnaire; telemedicine; eHealth","Hillestad R., Bigelow J., Bower A., Girosi F., Meili R., Scoville R., Taylor R., Can electronic medical record systems transform health care?

However, these e-learning solutions are not without cross-cultural challenges. In order to adequately utilize these resources, it is imperative that developers and organizations understand how to address differences in norms, preferences and values of culturally diverse individuals when designing WBI. When instruction does not effectively address student needs, users can be distracted, or even discouraged, from completing instruction and quite possibly reject the technology through which the instruction is delivered. The purpose of this paper is to present an examination of cross cultural challenges in implementing WBI, through a discussion of Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions, cultural technology perceptions, language barriers and user needs. The paper concludes with a discussion the implications of WBI and future trends in WBI design.","Individualism; Masculinity; Power Distance; Uncertainty Avoidance; Web-Based Instruction","","Armstrong D.J., Cole P., Managing distances and differences in geographically distributed work groups, Distributed Work, pp. 167-186, (2002);

The purpose of this paper is to apply individual-level measurement of cultural orientation, such as power distance and uncertainty avoidance, to the recent findings of computer self-efficacy and ERP adoption belief, such as perceived ease of use, based on the survey of 101 ERP system experts. An online survey methodology is used to gather data from the various industrial fields. The research model is constructed based on the findings of the previous studies in IS, management, and cultural psychology. The results indicate that low power distance and high uncertainty avoidance cultural orientation influence general CSE. In addition, uncertainty avoidance positively influences ease of use of ERP systems. As expected, general CSE positively influences ease of use of ERP systems. Training and managerial interventions through communication to improve these cultural orientations would be effective for the successful ERP systems project. The findings of this research would be helpful to the project managers, IS researchers, and ERP practitioners who want to understand the behavioral aspects of ERP systems adoption in the organization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An additional aim was to investigate the relationship between culture as perceived and culture as desired. Over 800 advanced students of economics, business administration and management from 10 countries participated in the study. They gave free descriptions of an organization they knew well and they rated their native companies on Hofstede's dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and masculinity. In addition, they indicated how they would like their native companies to be on the same dimensions. Both the data concerning the free descriptions and the data concerning the ratings of native companies show considerable support for Hofstede's four dimensions. Remarkably, there was hardly a relation between culture as perceived and culture as desired. The latter finding has important implications for the interpretation of the literature on national cultures. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Individualism; Masculinity; National cultures; Organizational cultures; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","","Cartwright S., Cooper C.L., The role of culture compatibility in successful organizational marriage, Academy of Management Executive, 7, pp. 57-70, (1993); Cartwright S., Cooper C.L., Managing Mergers, Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances: Integrating People and Cultures, (1996); Fernandez D.R., Carlson D.S., Stepina L.P., Nicholson J.D., Hofstede's Country Classification 25 years later, The Journal of Social Psychology, 137, pp. 43-54, (1997); Fiske A.P., The four elementary forms of sociality: Framework for a unified theory of social relations, Psychological Review, 99, pp. 689-723, (1992); Hofstede G., culture'S Consequences: International Differences in Work Related Values, (1980); Hofstede G., Cultures and Organizations, (1991); Hofstede G., Cultural constraints in management theories, Academy of Management Executive, 7, 1, pp. 81-94, (1993); Hoppe M.H., A Comparative Study of Country Elites: International Differences in Work-related Values and Learning and Their Implications for Management Training and Development, (1990); Jaeger A.M., Organization development and national culture: Where's the fit?, Academy of Management Review, 11, pp. 178-190, (1986); Laurent A., The cultural diversity of Western management conceptions, International Studies of Management and Organization, 8, 12, pp. 75-96, (1983); Levitt T., The globalization of markets, Harvard Business Review, 83, 3, pp. 92-102, (1983); Olie R., Shades of culture and institutions in international mergers, Organization Studies, 15, 3, pp. 381-405, (1994); Schwartz S.H., Universals in the content and structure of values: Theoretical advances and empirical tests in 20 countries, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 25, pp. 1-66, (1992); Schwartz S.H., Beyond individualism and collectivism: New cultural dimensions of values, Individualism and Collectivism: Theory, Method, and Applications, pp. 85-199, (1994); Smith P.B., Bond M.H., Social Psychology Across Culturesanalysis and Perspectives (2nd Ed.), (1998); Smith P.B., Schwartz S.H., Values, Handbook of Cross-cultural Psychology, Vol. 3, Social Behavior and Applications, pp. 77-118, (1997); Sondergaard, Research note: Hofstede's consequences: A study of reviews, citations and replications, Organization Studies, 15, 3, pp. 447-456, (1994); Triandis H.C., Culture and Social Behavior, (1994); Tung R.L., Expatriate assignments: Enhancing success and minimizing failure, The Academy of Management Executive, 1, 2, pp. 117-126, (1987); Van Oudenhoven J.P., De Boer T., Complementarity and similarity of partners in international mergers, Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 17, pp. 343-356, (1995)","","","","01471767","","","","English","Int.

We postulate that culture influences corporate risk-taking both through its effect on managerial decision-making and through its effect on a country's formal institutions. Further, we postulate that the influence of culture is conditioned on the extent of managerial discretion as measured by earnings discretion and firm size. Using firm-level data from 35 countries and employing a hierarchical linear modeling approach to isolate the effects of firm-level and country-level variables, we show that individualism has a positive and significant association, whereas uncertainty avoidance and harmony have negative and significant associations, with corporate risk-taking. Greater earnings discretion strengthens and larger firm size weakens the association of culture with corporate risk-taking. We conclude that even in a highly globalized world with sophisticated managers, culture matters. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate risk-taking; Formal institutions; G18; G31; G32; Harmony; Individualism; National culture; Uncertainty avoidance","","Acharya V.V., Amihud Y., Litov L., Creditor rights and corporate risk-taking, J.

Recent studies document that managerial discretion in adjusting resources leads to costs that are “sticky” in that costs respond less to decreases in activity than to increases in activity. We analyze how different dimensions of societal culture explain cross-country variation in cost stickiness. Using a sample of firms from 39 countries, we find that cost stickiness is less pronounced in countries with higher uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation. Our findings support the proposition that culture affects resource management decisions made by managers and, in doing so, our study makes a significant contribution in understanding differences in sticky cost behavior observed across countries. © 2016 University of Illinois","Cost behavior; Cost stickiness; Culture","","Abdolmohammadi M.J., Sarens G., An investigation of the association between cultural dimensions and variations in perceived use of and compliance with internal auditing standards in 19 countries, The International Journal of Accounting, 46, 4, pp. 365-389, (2011); Ahern K., Daminelli D., Fracassi C., Lost in translation?

Yet, countries differ dramatically on the prevalence of fatal work injuries (FWIs). Are these differences only a function of national economies and infrastructure or also related to entrenched cultural differences? This study tested whether the cultural dimensions of Hofstede, assessed in the 1970s, predict recent FWI in 22 European countries. We hypothesized that Power-Distance Index (PDI) and Masculinity would be positively correlated with FWI, while Individualism and Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) would be inversely correlated with FWI. We obtained the Hofstede cultural dimensions from Hofstede's online data, and obtained data on prevalence of FWI as well as national income and alcohol consumption. Results revealed that PDI was indeed positively and significantly correlated with FWI (r= 0.611, p< .05) while Individualism was inversely significantly related to FWI (r= -0.604, p< .05), independent of national income and alcohol consumption. Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity turned out not to be significantly correlated with FWI. These results show that cultural differences between countries can independently predict future risk of FWI on an international scale. The results also have implications towards organizational management and prevention management concerning FWI. Our study indicates that self-leadership can be a powerful approach to improve occupational safety. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Cultural dimensions; Fatal occupational accidents; Fatal work injuries; Statistical modeling","Occupational risks; Cultural dimensions; Fatal work injuries; International scale; Occupational accident; Organizational management; Prevention managements; Statistical modeling; Uncertainty avoidance; alcohol consumption; article; Belgium; Bulgaria; cultural factor; Czech Republic; Denmark; Estonia; Europe; fatal work injury; fatality; Finland; France; Germany; human; Hungary; income; individuality; Ireland; Italy; Luxembourg; Malta; masculinity; morbidity; mortality; Netherlands; Norway; occupational accident; occupational safety; Poland; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; Romania; Slovakia; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Forecasting","Bird E., Germain G.L., Practical Loss Control Leadership, The Conservation of People, Property, Process and Profits, (1985); (2011); (2012); Hale A., Conditions of occurrence of major and minor accidents urban myths, deviations and accident scenario's, Tijdschrift voor toegepaste Arbowetenschap, 15, 3, pp. 34-40, (2002); Heinrich H.W., Industrial Accident Prevention, (1950); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: International Differences in Work-related Values, (1980); Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviours, Institutions, and Organisations across Nations, (2001); Hofstede G., Hofstede G.J., Cultures and Organizations.

In particular, a country's horizontal collectivism may influence the intervention's effectiveness. Results based on a database of 90 organizational units from seven different countries in which ProMES, a productivity intervention, was implemented indicated that in general, ProMES is more successful in some European countries than in the United States. Furthermore, results indicate that this effect may be due to an interaction between power distance and social collectivism. The degree of collectivism plays an important role in predicting whether ProMES succeeds in countries with relatively low power distance. In countries that score relatively high in power distance, the intervention succeeds regardless of the degree of collectivism. Lastly, whether a country's level of uncertainty avoidance has implications for the success of ProMES is also explored. Implications are discussed. © 2007 NTL Institute.","Collectivism; Culture; Power distance; Productivity; Uncertainty avoidance","","Adler N.J., International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, (1986); Adler N.J., Cross-cultural motivation, Motivation and Work Behavior, pp. 320-326, (1991); Adler N.J., International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, (2002); Aiken L.S., West L.S., Multiple Regression.

Yet psychological research has shown that ecological factors can influence cognition, mood, and behavior. Following Van de Vliert's climatic demands-resources theory, I proposed the view of a climatoeconomic contextualization of generalized social trust. Specifically, I found that the interplay of thermal climates (harshness) and wealth (GDP per capita) was related to generalized social trust, mediated by uncertainty avoidance rather than other cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism, masculinity-femininity, and power distance. These findings render direct support to Hofstede's hypothesis that societal cultures are first-stage outcomes of climatic factors and second-stage intermediaries between these climatic factors and the sociopsychological functioning of markets, organizations, groups, and individuals. They also provide important implications for trust theory and climatic demands-resources theory. © The Author(s) 2012.","culture; thermal climate; trust; uncertainty avoidance; wealth","","Aiken L.S., West S.G., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Alesina A., Devleeschauwer A., Easterly W., Kurlat S., Wacziarg R., Fractionalization, Journal of Economic Growth, 8, pp. 155-194, (2003); Alesina A., la Ferrara E., Who trusts others?, Journal of Public Economics, 85, pp. 207-234, (2002); Allik J., Realo A., Individualism-collectivism and social capital, Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 35, pp. 29-49, (2004); Anderson C., Galinsky A.D., Power, optimism, and risk-taking, European Journal of Social Psychology, 46, pp. 511-536, (2006); Aryee S., Budhwar P.S., Chen Z.X., Trust as a mediator of the relationship between organizational justice and work outcomes: Test of a social exchange model, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23, pp. 267-285, (2002); Axelrod R., The Evolution of Cooperation, (1984); Bachmann R., At the crossroads: Future directions in trust research, Journal of Trust Research, 1, pp. 203-213, (2011); Bargh J.A., Shalev I., The substitutability of physical and social warmth in daily life, Emotion; Berg J., Dickhaut J., McCabe K., Trust, reciprocity, and social history, Games and Economic Behavior, 10, pp. 122-142, (1995); Bjornskov C., Determinants of generalized trust: A cross-country comparison, Public Choice, 130, pp. 1-21, (2006); Blau P.M., Exchange and Power in Social Life, (1964); Cohen J., Cohen P., West S.G., Aiken L.S., Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, (2003); Coleman J.S., Foundations of Social Theory, (1990); Colquitt J.A., LePine J.A., Piccolo R.F., Zapata C.P., Rich B.L., Explaining the justice-performance relationship: Trust as exchange deepener or trust as uncertainty reducer?, Journal of Applied Psychology, 97, pp. 1-15, (2012); Colquitt J.A., Scott B.A., LePine J.A., Trust, trustworthiness, and trust propensity: A meta-analytic test of their unique relationships with risk taking and job performance, Journal of Applied Psychology, 92, pp. 909-927, (2007); Cropanzano R., Mitchell M.S., Social exchange theory: An interdisciplinary review, Journal of Management, 31, pp. 874-900, (2005); Cunningham M.R., Weather, mood and helping behavior: Quasi-experiments with the Sunshine Samaritan, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37, pp. 1947-1956, (1979); Delhey J., Newton K., Who trusts?

Significant effects of Hofstede's national culture scores, age, gender, organization ownership and department function are found. After these main effects have been discounted, significant although weak interactions are found, indicating that demographic effects are stronger in individualist, low power distance nations than elsewhere. Significant non-predicted interaction effects of uncertainty avoidance and masculinity-femininity are also obtained. The implications for theory and practice of the use of demographic attributes in understanding effective management procedures in various parts of the world are discussed.

Several researchers have provided empirical evidence suggesting that an organization's readiness is one of the most important antecedents of e-business adoption; however, despite often comparable levels of organizational readiness, tremendous variations in the national level of ebusiness adoption can still be observed. We argue that cultural specifics can explain these variations to a great extent, and report results from a pan-European empirical study conducted among 14,065 enterprises from 29 different countries. Measuring culture by Hofstede's (2001) well-known cultural dimensions we are able to show that national culture significantly moderates the relationship of organizational readiness and e-business adoption. Power distance, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance were found to exert a significant influence on the relation between organizational readiness and e-business-adoption. We suggest that decision makers interested in ebusiness consider these cultural effects prior to starting new initiatives. © 2009, Authors.

In this article the authors argue that national culture also matters. National culture systematically influences individual preferences, therefore national culture may provide an additional explanation of the choice of coordination mechanisms. The problem is studied in the context of two nations, Sweden and China, and in the context of two coordination mechanisms, market and hierarchical mechanisms. It is suggested that market mechanisms are preferred in cultures characterized by high levels of performance orientation, assertiveness, and in-group collectivism and low levels of institutional collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance. A preference for hierarchical mechanisms is suggested in cultures that have the opposite characteristics. Based on the cultural characteristics of Sweden and China, as identified in the Globe report, this leads to the hypothesis that China is biased towards market mechanisms whereas Sweden is biased towards hierarchical mechanisms. An experimental study was designed to test the hypothesis, involving groups of students of Swedish and Chinese origin. The students performed roles as principals/agents in repeated production. Before each period the pairs negotiated contracts and chose between piece-rate payments (a market mechanism) or fixed-rate payments (a hierarchical mechanism). The result supports the hypothesis. A comparison found that Swedish students preferred hierarchical mechanisms whereas Chinese students preferred market mechanisms. © Håkan Pihl, Marcus Bornholt, Marianne Elfversson, Andreas Johnsson, 2010.","Coordination mechanisms; Culture; Experimental study; Market and hierarchical mechanisms","","Alchain A.A., Demsetz H., Production, information cost and economic organization, American Economic Review, 62, pp. 777-795, (1972); Alchain A.A., Woodward S., Reflections on the theory of the firm, Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics, pp. 110-136, (1987); Arrow K.J., Information and economic behavior, Federation of Swedish Industries, pp. 5-28, (1973); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Bartlett C.A., Ghoshal S., Transnational Management.

In particular, Hofstede's cultural dimension 'uncertainty avoidance' had a significant negative relationship with the implementation rate of integrated curricula. Aims: However, some schools succeeded to adopt curriculum changes despite their country's strong uncertainty avoidance. This raised the question: 'How did those schools overcome the barrier of uncertainty avoidance?' Method: Austria offered the combination of a high uncertainty avoidance score and integrated curricula in all its medical schools. Twenty-seven key change agents in four medical universities were interviewed and transcripts analysed using thematic cross-case analysis. Results: Initially, strict national laws and limited autonomy of schools inhibited innovation and fostered an 'excuse culture': 'It's not our fault. It is the ministry's'. A new law increasing university autonomy stimulated reforms. However, just this law would have been insufficient as many faculty still sought to avoid change. A strong need for change, supportive and continuous leadership, and visionary change agents were also deemed essential. Conclusions: In societies with strong uncertainty avoidance strict legislation may enforce resistance to curriculum change.

Knowing how and in which phases of implementation different dimensions of national culture can effect on implementation, would be for ERP managers and consultants very important. In this Paper, by means of a questionnaire survey in a manufacturing company in Iran, first, we determined critical success factors in each phase of ASAP methodology in implementing ERP, Second, We identified the amount of influence of each CSF form each dimension of Hofstede cultural dimensions, and finally by considering the relationship between different cultural dimensions and different phases of implementation via CSFs, we identified in each phase of implementation, which cultural dimensions and through which CSFs can impact on implementation. Some of the findings of our study reveal that cultural dimensions of ""Uncertainty Avoidance"" and ""Long-Term Orientation"" have the most influence on the ERP implementation via different CSFs in different phases. Respect to paper results and also scores of Hofstede cultural dimensions for every country (that has identified amount of weakness of countries in each cultural dimension), the managers and consultants can understand how and where is the impacts of those cultural dimension that their country is weak in them in implementation.","Asap methodology; Critical success factors; ERP implementation; Hofstede cultural dimensions","Managers; Manufacture; Surveys; Asap methodology; Critical success factor; Cultural dimensions; ERP implementation; Long-term orientation; Manufacturing companies; Questionnaire surveys; Uncertainty avoidance; Enterprise resource planning","Ertugrul Karsak E., Okan Ozogul C., An integrated decision making approach for ERP system selection, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, pp. 660-667, (2009); Cyrus K.M., Vaezi Nejad A., The influence of dimensions of national culture on CSFs of ERP implementation: A case study, Proceeding of the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC 2011), (2011); Yusuf Y., Gunasekaran A., Wu C., Implementation of enterprise resource planning in China, Technovation, 26, pp. 1324-1336, (2006); Huang Z., Palvia P., ERP implementation issues in advanced and developing countries, Business Process Management, 7, pp. 276-284, (2001); McCoy S., Integrating National Cultural into Individual is Adoption Research: The Need for Individual Level Measures, (2003); Kumar K., Van Hillsgersberg J., ERP experiences and evolution, Communications of the ACM, 43, 4, pp. 23-26, (2000); Al-Mashari M., Al-Mudimigh A., ERP implementation: Lessons from a case study, Information Technology and People, 16, 1, pp. 21-29, (2003); Fan M., Stalert J., Whinston A., The adoption and design methodologies of component-based enterprise systems, European Journal of Information Systems, 1, pp. 25-35, (2000); Bocij P., Chaffey D., Greasley A., Hickie S., Business Information Systems, (2003); 2014 ERP Report, (2014); The 2014 Manufacturing ERP Report, (2014); Rockart F., Chief executives define their own data needs, Harvard Business Review, 2, pp. 81-93, (1979); Boynlon A.C., Zmud R.W., An assessment of critical success factors, Sloan Management Review, 25, 4, pp. 2-17, (1984); Bullen C., Rockart J., A Primer on Critical Success Factors, the Rise of Managerial Computing: The Best of the Center for Information System Research, pp. 383-423, (1986); Ehie I.C., Madsen M., Identifying critical issues in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation, Computers in Industry, 56, pp. 545-557, (2005); Shanks G., Parr A., Hu B., Differences in critical success factors in ERP systems implementation in Australia and china: A cultural analysis, Proceedings of the European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2000 Proceedings, (2000); Cyrus K.M., Vaezi Nejad A., The critical success factors across ASAP methodology in ERP implementation, CIE42 Proceedings, (2012); Al-Mashari M., Al-Mudimigh A., Zairi M., Enterprise resource planning: A taxonomy of critical factors, European Journal of Operational Research, 146, pp. 352-364, (2003); Bradley J., Management based critical success factors in the implementation of enterprise resource planning systems, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9, pp. 175-200, (2008); Cantu R., A Framework for Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning Systems in Small Manufacturing Companies, (1999); Sun A.Y.T., Yazdani A., Overend J.D., Achievement assessment for enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementations based on critical success factors (CSFs), Int.

Our data-72 in-depth interviews of advanced ICT users - were coded, analyzed, and placed into Hofstede's four dimensional framework (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and masculinity). We proposed that ICT use comparisons between the two countries are congruent to Hofstede's findings. We find partial support for these propositions. As expected, Norway and the US are similar on two dimensions (power distance and uncertainty avoidance), but contrary to expectations, they are also similar on the two dimensions where we expected differences (individualism and masculinity). We suggest possible explanations for these findings, including our focus on an expert-user subculture, external triggering events, and technical codes inscribed in Internet applications and software.","Cross-Cultural Studies;

We expect a firm's home country culture to have a strong impact on these perceptions, resulting in systematic variation in firm entry timing strategies across firms' country of origin. To this perspective, we integrate extant research which suggests that the host country political environment will also impact entry timing. Our findings support the argument that home country cultural attributes directly influence whether a firm decides to enter a country earlier or later than other firms, and that the host country's political environment moderates these effects. Specifically, we find that firms from high performance orientation and high power distance tend to enter countries earlier on average; we also find that countries with weak political freedoms trigger late-entry strategies for firms from high uncertainty avoidance cultures, but early-entry strategies for firms from collectivist cultures. Our findings are the first in the entry timing literature to examine the role of a firm's home country cultural attributes and underscore the importance of the cultural and political environments on strategic decision-making across diverse home and host country contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","","Commerce; Risk perception; Social sciences; Cultural attribute; Cultural determinants; Entry timing; Foreign market entries; Host countries; Strategic decision making; Systematic variation; Uncertainty avoidance; corporate strategy; decision making; industrial performance; industrial practice; market conditions; political integration; Industry","Agarwal R., Sarkar M., Echambadi R., The Conditioning effect of time on firm survival: an industry life cycle approach, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 5, pp. 971-994, (2002); Alpert F., Kamins M., Graham J., Sakano T., Onzo N., Pioneer Brand Advantage in the United States and Japan, (1996); Bae J., Lawler J., Organizational and HRM strategies in Korea: impact on firm performance in an emerging economy, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 3, pp. 502-517, (2000); Barkema H., Vermeulen F., What differences in the cultural backgrounds of partners are detrimental for international joint ventures?, Journal of International Business Studies, 28, 4, pp. 845-864, (1997); Barney J., Firm resources and sustained competitive advantage, Journal of Management, 17, 1, pp. 99-120, (1991); Berndt E., Bui L., Reiley D., Urban G., Information, marketing, and pricing in the U.S. antiulcer drug market, American Economic Review, 85, 2, pp. 100-105, (1995); Bhagat R., Kedia B., Harveston P., Triandis H., Cultural variations in the cross-border transfer of organizational knowledge: an integrative framework, Academy of Management Journal, 27, 2, pp. 204-221, (2002); Bohlmann J., Golder P., Mitra D., Deconstructing the pioneer's advantage: examining vintage effects and consumer valuations of quality and variety, Management Science, 48, 9, pp. 1175-1195, (2002); Bontempo R., Bottom W., Weber E., Cross-cultural differences in risk perception: a model-based approach, Risk Analysis, 17, 4, pp. 479-488, (2006); Breusch T., Pagan R., A simple test for heteroscedasticity and random coefficient variation, Econometrica, 47, 5, pp. 1287-1294, (1976); Brewer M., Chen Y., Where (who) are collectives in collectivism?

Despite the fact that tourists' destination decision-making has attracted lots of concentration, it is noteworthy that few of them touched the relationship between safety perception and destination decision in the perspective of influence process. In order to better understand the influence process of safety perception on travel destination decision-making is still scant, an integrated model based on the two well-tested model, elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), is proposed in the paper. Cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance, which related directly to safety issues, are extended to the model. Altogether seven hypotheses are given based on the conceptual framework. Conclusions on the contribution of this paper, and limitations and future research are also discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","destination decision; ELM; perceived safety; TPB; uncertainty avoidance","Decision making; Information science; Conceptual frameworks; Cultural dimensions; destination decision; Elaboration likelihood models; ELM; Theory of Planned Behavior; TPB; Uncertainty avoidance; Accident prevention","Pan B., Fesenmaier D.R., Online Information Search, Annals of Tourism Research, 33, 3, pp. 809-832, (2006); Berne C., Garcia-Gonzalez M., Mugica J., How ICT shifts the power balance of tourism distribution channels, Tourism Management, 33, 1, pp. 205-214, (2012); Floyd M.F., Pennington-Gray L., Profiling risk perceptions of tourists, Annals of Tourism Research, 31, 4, pp. 1051-1054, (2004); Gardiner S., King C., Grace D., Travel Decision Making: An Empirical Examination of Generational Values, Attitudes, and Intentions, Journal of Travel Research, 52, 3, pp. 310-324, (2013); Mutinda R., Mayaka M., Application of destination choice model: Factors influencing domestic tourists destination choice among residents of Nairobi, Kenya, Tourism Management, 33, 6, pp. 1593-1597, (2012); Wong J.-Y., Yeh C., Tourist hesitation in destination decision making, Annals of Tourism Research, 36, 1, pp. 6-23, (2009); Tarlow P.E., Santana G., Providing safety for tourists: A study of a selected sample of tourist destinations in the United States and Brazil, Journal of Travel Research, 40, 4, pp. 424-431, (2002); Hsu T.H., Lin L.Z., Using fuzzy set theoretic techniques to analyze travel risk: An empirical study, Tourism Management, 27, 5, pp. 968-981, (2006); Haddock C., Wisheart P., (1993); Reisinger Y., Mavondo F., Cultural Differences in Travel Risk Perception, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 20, 1, pp. 13-31, (2006); Bauer R.A., Consumer behavior as risk taking, Dynamic Marketing For a Changing World, (1960); Stone R.N., Winter F., Risk In Buyer Behavior Contexts: A Clarification.

However, many governments still face the problem of low level adoption of eGovernment websites. It is because the issue of eGovernment adoption is complex and multidimensional in nature. In consequence, it must be carefully addressed not only from technological perspectives but also from social, cultural, and organizational perspectives. The business case for developing sustainable successful eGovernment initiatives critically depends on our knowledge and understanding of how to increase citizen adoption of eGovernment websites. A review of the literature, however, shows that much of extant eGovernment research has focused on eGovernment adoption in developed countries. In consequence, little is known about national cultural factors that may influence eGovernment adoption in developing countries. This knowledge gap is particularly apparent in Jordan. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine national cultural factors that may influence citizen adoption of eGovernment websites in this culturally different part of the world. We developed an integrated model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with Hofstede's national culture dimensions, which is used to evaluate the impact of national culture on eGovernment adoption in this paper. Based on survey data collected from a total of 197 Jordanian citizens, evidence shows that while two cultural dimensions: power distance and uncertainty avoidance had significant impacts on citizens' intention to adopt eGovernment, the other three cultural dimensions: individualism, masculinity, and long-term orientation had no discernible impacts. The results also indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude are significant indicators of citizens' intention to use state government services online.","Culture; eGovernment adoption;

Drawing on project management practitioner job advertisements placed by 2040 organisations across seven countries and seven industries, we employ Hofstede's national cultural framework to categorise cultural preferences which the organisations persistently replicate in their specifications of desired candidate project management practitioner competency. To map global trends and national variations, data analysis is undertaking and utilising exploratory data analysis, Poisson regression and negative binomial regression are used. The paper finds that specific national cultural dimensions - 'Collectivism', 'Uncertainty Avoidance' and, to a lesser extent, 'Power Distance' - are the most salient cultural denominators for advertised project management positions, while this is not the case with 'Masculinity' and 'Individualism'. The findings raise issues about which organisations should seek to become more culturally intelligent, and which relate to the adaptiveness of the cultural preferences that they articulate through their job advertisements, both to project tasks and to cultural contexts for projects. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","cultural intelligence; cultural values; Project management","Data handling; Information analysis; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Cultural dimensions; cultural intelligence; Cultural value; Exploratory data analysis; Management professionals; Negative binomial regression; Poisson regression; Uncertainty avoidance; Project management","Ahsan K., Ho M., Khan S., Recruiting Project Managers: A Comparative Analysis of Competencies and Recruitment Signals from Job Advertisements, Project Management Journal, 44, 5, pp. 36-54, (2013); Ang S., Van Dyne L., Handbook of Cultural Intelligence: Theory, Measurement, and Applications, (2008); Ang S., Van Dyne L., Koh C., Ng K., Templer K., Tay C., Chandrasekar N., Cultural Intelligence: Its Measurement and Effects on Cultural Judgment and Decision Making, Cultural Adaptation and Task Performance, Management and Organization Review, 3, 3, pp. 335-371, (2007); Body of Knowledge, (2012); Competency Framework, (2015); Born M., Taris T., The Impact of the Wording of Employment Advertisements on Students' Inclination to Apply for a Job, The Journal of Social Psychology, 150, 5, pp. 485-502, (2010); Bourdieu P., Outline of a Theory of Practice, (1977); Boyd D., Jiao-Zhong G., Expert System for Production Manager Recruitment, Production Planning & Control, 2, 4, pp. 359-363, (1991); Breaugh J., Employee Recruitment: Current Knowledge and Important Areas for Future Research, Human Resource Management Review, 18, 3, pp. 103-118, (2008); Bredillet C., Tywoniak S., Dwivedula R., What is a Good Project Manager?

A sample of chief internal auditors from 67 listed companies has been used to examine the direct effect of the cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and individualism on the QIA. Evidence was found that organizations, in which power distance and uncertainty avoidance are high, are characterized by lower QIA. The results also show a positive association between individualism and the QIA, indicating that internal audit is largely based on the accomplishments of the individual internal auditors associated with the process. Considering these outcomes from the Saudi Arabian standpoint, where the cultural and economic contexts are underpinned by collectivism rather than individualism, it emerges that it is only comparatively recently that a tradition of governance and audit has started to develop, and that quite particular and strong cultural influences stemming from tribalism and pervasive core traditions beliefs operate to condition the effort to achieve the ideal internal audit environment. ©The Author(s) 2014.","culture;

The proposition merits investigation because it has important implications for local as well as international and global companies. The study first investigates employees' perceptions of the existing and preferred cultural orientations in four Jordanian organizations, and then it compares the results with other studies conducted in other cultures (American and South African). In Jordan data were collected by means of Harrison and Stokes survey for diagnosing organizational culture, the same instrument used in the USA and in South Africa. The study concludes by suggesting that in certain countries the national culture's effects may appearin a particular dominant organizational culture, that is desired by the management, but not actually preferred by employees. This implies that it is more beneficial for international and transnational corporations to develop “strong” cultures ratherthan to encourage local units to adapt to their national cultures. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Achievement; Arab culture; Individualism; Jordan; National culture; Organizational culture; Power distance; Uncertainty avoidance","","Abdel-Khaliq N., Al-Abaad A1 Bieyah Lil Birocratia Al Kuwaitia”, (Environmental Dimensions of Bureaucracy in Kuwait), Studies in the Gulf and Arabia, 10, 38, pp. 13-65, (1984); Adler N., International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, (1986); Al-Hegelan H., Palmer M., Bureaucracy and development in Saudi Arabia, Middle Eastern Journal, 39, pp. 48-59, (1985); Al-Kubaisy A., Theory' and Practice of Administrative Development in a New Nation, Dissertation Abstracts I, A32, (1985); Ali A., Sabri H., Organizational Culture and Job Satisfaction in Jordan, Journal of Transnational Management Development, 6, 1-2, pp. 105-118, (2001); Ali A., Cultural Discontinuity and Arab Management Thoughts, International Studies of Management and Organization, 25, 3, pp. 7-30, (1995); Allaire Y., Firsirotu M.E., Theories of Organizational Culture, Organization Studies, 5, 3, pp. 193-226, (1984); Allen F.R., Kraft C., The Organizational Unconscious.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data obtained from a secondary source. The dimensions of national culture used in this paper come from Hofstede's work. Two analyses are performed on the data. First, a non-parametric test is conducted to determine whether there are significant differences on the 13 IT security concerns when the dimensions of national culture are used to group responses. Second, a correlation analysis is carried out between the study's variables. Findings - First, the results indicate that the dimensions of national culture are not statistically important in differentiating responses and perceptions of IT security concerns across GFSI. Second, some of the dimensions of national culture are found to have significant correlations with a few of the IT security concerns investigated. Research limitations/implications - The use of a secondary data source introduces some limitations. The views captured in the survey are those of management team, it is likely that end-users' perceptions may vary considerably. Nonetheless, the main finding of the paper for corporate managers in the financial services industry is that IT security concerns appear to be uniform across cultures. Further, the data show that the dimension of uncertainty avoidance deserves further attention with regard to the assessment of security concerns in GFSI. This information may be useful for decision making and planning purposes in the financial services industry. Originality/value - This paper is believed to be among the first to examine the impacts of national culture on IT security concerns in GFSI. The paper's conclusions may offer useful insights to corporate managers in the industry. Copyright © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The potentially dynamic nature of national culture, as opposed to a more static approach that is often assumed in management research using a Hofstede framework, is examined. The evidence of relative sample convergence, particularly in relation to collectivism and uncertainty avoidance, along with select, individual region static positions for cultural dimensions provide support for the crossvergence theory [Ralston, D., Holt, D, Terpstra, R., Kai-Cheng, Y., 1997. The impact of national culture and economic ideology on managerial work values: a study of the U.S., Russia, Japan and China. Journal of International Business Studies 28, 177-207]. Pragmatically the research suggests organizational policies and practices should be updated for maximum effectiveness in relation to crossverging realities and that culture is not static. Academically the research cautions use of approaches that rely on dated rankings for cultural indicators as a basis for current examination since relative cultural positions among regions and nations are also not static. © 2006.","Banking; Crossvergence; Culture; Hofstede; Hong Kong; Taiwan; United States","","Ang S., Leong S., Out of the mouths of babes: business ethics and youths in Asia, Journal of Business Ethics, 28, pp. 129-144, (2000); Au A., Wong D., The impact of Guanxi on the ethical decision-making process of auditors: an exploratory study on Chinese CPAs in Hong Kong, Journal of Business Ethics, 28, pp. 87-93, (2000); Birnbaum-More P., Wong G., Olve N., Acquisition of managerial values in the PRC and Hong Kong, Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 26, pp. 255-275, (1995); Bollen K., Structural Equations with Latent Variables, (1989); Bollen K., Long J., Testing Structural Equation Models, (1993); Bond M., Chinese values and the search for cultural-free dimensions of culture, Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology, 18, 2, pp. 143-164, (1987); Brislin R., Cross-Cultural Encounters: Face to Face Interaction, (1981); Brislin R., Loaner W., Thorndike R., Cross-Cultural Methods, (1973); Brislin R., MacNab B., Bechtold D., Translation, Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology, 3, pp. 587-595, (2004); Casson M., Lundan M., Explaining international differences in economic institutions, International Studies of Management & Organization, 29, 2, pp. 25-42, (1999); Chan M., Hong Kong in transition: the handover years/Hong Kong the super paradox: life after return to China, Public Affairs, 75, 1, pp. 109-114, (2002); Cheung G., Chow H., Subcultures in Greater China: a comparison of managerial values in the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 16, pp. 369-387, (1999); Child J., Yan Y., National and transnational effects in international business: indications from Sino-foreign JVs, Management International Review, 41, 1, pp. 53-75, (2001); Cushner K., Brislin R., Intercultural Interactions: A Practical Guide. 2nd edition, (1996); DiMaggio P., Powell W., The iron cage revisited: institutional isomorphism and collective rationality in organizational fields, American Sociological Review, 48, pp. 147-160, (1983); Fiske A., The four elementary forms of sociality: framework for a unified theory of social relations, Psychological Review, 99, pp. 689-723, (1992); Fiske A., Using individualism and collectivism to compare cultures-a critique of the validity and measurement of the constructs: comment on Oyserman et al.

Several studies have recognized that culture affects ethical behavior. However, very few studies have been conducted on how culture affects managers' attitudes towards business ethics which may predict their ethical behavior especially in developing African countries. The focal point is that this study is to address this knowledge gap in the literature. Design/methodology/approach - The author collected data from 351 managers in selected firms in Nigeria. Two instruments were used to measure Hofstede's five cultural dimensions and attitudes toward business ethics. Correlation and regression analysis were used to test and predict the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables in the study. Findings - Results show that culture has a significant influence on ethical attitudes of managers. The findings also specifically revealed that relationships exist among Hofstede's cultural dimension of power distance, collectivism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, short-term orientation and the dimensions of attitudes towards business ethics. Research limitations/ implications - The generalization of the findings may be limited by some of the sample characteristics. First, the study was limited to six cities in Nigeria; as a result, broader geographic sampling would better represent the national profile. Second, the drop off and pick up method used in data collection and the usual social-desirability bias associated with survey research could be limitations for the study. However, the author took extreme measures to protect the identities of the respondents. Finally, replication of this study using larger samples and a broader geographic base is suggested for cross-validation purposes. Practical implications - Understanding that ethical beliefs and moral decision-making are dependent on culture and play an important role in managing and developing a successful ethics program. The results can help multinational corporations in developing effective culturally based ethical codes of conduct; as well as to design and manage targeted ethical policies and programs that will actively motivate, stimulate, support, encourage, and promote an outstanding ethical organization in Nigeria. Originality/value - There have been very few previous studies on how culture affects managers' attitude toward business ethics within the sub-Saharan African context. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first empirical study on this topic in Nigeria, a sub-Saharan African country. The results provide insights on how culture can influence ethical attitude of managers in Nigeria. As a ground-breaking study on this topic in Nigeria, the findings may provide managers and scholars with an understanding of impact of culture on ethics. The insights gained from this study will contribute to the future research development on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the study is of significant value to practitioners and scholars alike. Copyright © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Taking the cultural differences into consideration is critical for a successful Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation. The literature indicates that the cultural differences cause difficulties in the implementation of Western ERP software programs in developing countries. In this research, by means of a questionnaire survey, we identified the most influential Critical Success Factors (CSFs) from each dimension of Hofstede cultural dimensions. Considering Iran's scores of Hofstede cultural dimensions, we can support ERP managers and consultants with guidelines on influential CSFs in areas of weak or undesirable cultural dimensions. The findings of our study reveal that Iran's highest ranked dimension, Uncertainty Avoidance, has the most influence on ""clear and defined goals and objectives"", ""organizational support"" and ""minimal customization"". Also Iran's second highest Hofstede ranking dimension, Power Distance, mostly affects ""organizational culture"", ""top management support"" and ""organizational support"". The other results and recommendation have brought in the end of this paper. © 2011 IEEE.","Critical Success Factors; ERP implementation; Hofstede cultural dimensions","Artificial intelligence; Developing countries; Electronic commerce; Management science; Surveys; Critical success factor; Cultural difference; Cultural dimensions; Enterprise resource planning implementations; ERP implementation; ERP software; National cultures; Organizational behavior; Organizational cultures; Organizational support; Questionnaire surveys; Top management support; Uncertainty avoidance; Enterprise resource planning","Yusuf Y., Gunasekaran A., Wu C., Implementation of enterprise resource planning in China, Technovation, 26, pp. 1324-1336, (2006); Hong K.K., Kim Y.G., The critical success factors for ERP implementation: An organizational fit perspective, Information & Management, 40, pp. 25-40, (2002); Hong K., Kim Y., The critical success factors for ERP implementation: An organizational fit perspective, Information & Management, 40, pp. 25-40, (2002); McCoy S., Integrating National Cultural into Individual IS Adoption Research: The Need for Individual Level Measures, (2003); Fan M., Stalert J., Whinston A., The adoption and design methodologies of component-based enterprise systems, European Journal of Information Systems, 1, pp. 25-35, (2000); 2011 ERP Report, 2011, (2011); Rockhart J.F., Critical success factors, Harvard Business Review, pp. 81-91, (1979); Bullen C., Rockart J., A Primer on critical success factors, The Rise of Managerial Computing: The Best of the Center for Information System Research, pp. 383-423, (1986); Ehie I.C., Madsen M., Identifying critical issues in enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation, Computers in Industry, 56, pp. 545-557, (2005); Shanks G., Et al., Differences in critical success factors in ERP systems implementation in australia and china: A cultural analysis, Proceedings of the European Conference on Information Systems; Al-Mashari M., Al-Mudimigh A., Zairi M., Enterprise resource planning: A taxonomy of critical factors, European Journal of Operational Resarch, 146, pp. 352-364, (2003); Bradley J., Management based critical success factors in the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning systems, International Journal of Accounting Information Systems, 9, pp. 175-200, (2008); Cantu R., A Framework for Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning Systems in Small Manufacturing Companies, (1999); Sun A.Y.T., Yazdani A., Overend J.D., Achievement assessment for enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementations based on critical success factors (CSFs), Int.

Field sales employees (n = 147) in a multinational organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were surveyed to test the research model. Four of 7 primary hypotheses were supported, predicting more than 65% of the variance in the research model. Effort expectancy, uncertainty avoidance, collective performance expectancy, and internal/organizational social influence all showed antecedent significance to contextual utilization of CRM technology. The results of this study suggest that group-oriented individual decision making and the related concept of institutional collectivism are equally as important as individual-oriented decision making in the international utilization of organizational technology. Based on the strong significance shown in the results of this study, it would also be wise to consider cultural value–derived uncertainty avoidance in practical development of training and implementation of multinational CRM systems. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","culture;

The literature review was based on a multi-disciplinary research approach by incorporating organizational factors, cultural dimensions, and user satisfaction in implementation of ERP for developing countries. The eight ERP software's customers in Thailand were chosen for eleven semi-structured interviews performed during the period of April 2007 to April 2008. The findings confirm that management commitment, IT maturity, and computer culture are important factors influencing user satisfaction of the ERP projects. A company with richer Business Process Redesign (BPR) experience is more likely to succeed with ERP. Interestingly, the collectivism of ERP teamwork and composition is also critical issue for ERP implementation's satisfactions. Dealing with masculinity of users may lead to more satisfactions toward ERP implementation. Solving high uncertainty avoidance tends to boost users confidence and familiarity of users. The findings and recommendations can be useful for developing countries with similar conditions.","Culture; Developing country; ERP; Hofstede; Organization; User satisfaction","Cell culture; Developing countries;

In order to accommodate the international growth of the Internet, this mono-cultural bias of Website design must change. If crucial steps of user-centered user-interface (UI) development for Websites are omitted, which happens when people unconsciously apply their own rules to interactive communication intended for others, effective communication of the Website will be less successful, or may even be dysfunctional. People from different countries/cultures have certain expectations of a particular site that may differ significantly from other countries/cultures. For example, many middle-class Germans may typically prefer a design that is more subdued and easy to navigate, while many middle-class Mexicans may prefer a more colorful screen and tolerate more ambiguity. The present study is derived from the previous efforts of Marcus and Baumgartner [4, 5], Using five cultural dimensions (from Hofstede, as a useful, well-known set) and the schema of five UI design components, Marcus and Baumgartner created a five-by-five matrix that allowed for twenty-five fields of interest. The authors analyzed 12 corporate business-to-business and business-to-consumer interactive Websites and found patterns in divergence from corporate design standards. Baumgartner, with Marcus' assistance, also analyzed a set of 29 culture dimensions abstracted from nine models and presented to a group of 57 experts. The two authors analyzed the experts' evaluations of the importance of each dimension [2], They reviewed this list to derive which items comprised the top five in levels of importance. ""Best of breed"" culture dimensions are context, technology, uncertainty avoidance, time perception, and authority conception, in that order. Context is described as the amount and specificity of information in a given communication. The cultural dimension of technology is comprised of the experience of technology and technological development. As a cultural dimension, technology has to do with the development and attitude of the members of a certain society towards technological development. The cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance takes into account the behavior of the user regarding uncertain or unknown situations. Time perception concerns whether one has a long- or short-term orientation to achieving objectives and whether one is oriented to the past, present, or future. This cultural dimension can be related to the perceived amount of time that it takes to comprehend and utilize a © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007 Website. Authority conception concerns how people think of authority and the way their behavior is influenced when reacting to a Web UI design as official and authoritative, or not [4,5]. Hofstede's five cultural indexes include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, gender roles, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term time orientation. Power distance is defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. This index measures whether or not there is a strong representation of inequality of a society. Individualism is the opposite of collectivism. This index demonstrates how loose or tight the ties are between individuals and their society at large. Masculinity is generally understood to be the opposite of femininity. This index refers to the roles people play according to their genders. Uncertainty avoidance concerns a society's tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. This index includes to what extent a culture programs its members to feel either comfortable or uncomfortable in unstructured situations. Long-term time orientation is generally the opposite of short-term time orientation. Long-term time orientation values thrift, education, and perseverance, while short-term time-orientation is concerned more with the achieving short-term goals, fulfilling obligations, and protecting one's self under changing conditions [3]'. This study concerns an analysis of certain (undisclosable) public-facing pages of a financial-related Website by individuals from different countries and cultures. Based on the previously cited studies and after Website design interviews with twenty-four individuals from eleven different countries, the authors of this paper intend to shed light on these two questions: which dimensions seem to have the strongest impact or effect on a particular ethnic group? What considerations about culture should developers take into account when designing Websites for specific cultures/countries? The authors used a working Website and carried out user-preferences tests. Preferences were extracted from a questionnaire of seven distinct questions that were based on the usability of and user opinions of the Website. The questionnaire consisted of three parts. The first part inquired about demographic variables. The second part contained questions based on the navigation of the Website. The third part measured the user experience and preferences. The goal of the user tests was to examine whether users with culturally different backgrounds experience and evaluate Websites in a way that is consistent with their culture-specific attributes. The participants selected for this experiment ranged from students to professionals, with an age range of 20-50, all living in the San Francisco Bay area of California. The participants had been living in the United States for less than five years and came directly from their respective countries, which included Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. When comparing the final results with Hofstede's cultural dimensions, the following results became clear: cultural dimensions must be considered in order for a Website to be effective. For example, cultures like Russia and Slovakia, with a high level of power distance find Websites most useful when they have concise language and demonstrate a high level of professionalism. Countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Great Britain and Canada, which have a shorter-term time orientation, desire a Website that is quick to navigate and does not require a lot of time and effort through which to browse. Participants from countries with a high index score for uncertainty avoidance, such as Argentina, France and Mexico, are not trusting of Website content, want Websites that look highly official and professional, want them in their own languages. Countries that ranked relatively higher in individualism, such as Italy, need to have a Website design that is particular to their culture and country. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Culture; Design; Dimensions; Interface; User; Web","Color; Computer aided design; Uncertainty analysis; User interfaces; Colorful screen; Cultural dimension; Website design; Websites","Cook J., Finlayson M., The Impact of Cultural Diversity on Website Design, Advanced Management Journal, 70, 3, pp. 15-23; Hoftstede G., Cultures and Organizations, (1997); Marcus A., Baumgartner V., User-Interface Design vs. Culture, Proceedings, International Conference on Internationalization of Products and Services (IWIPS, pp. 67-78, (2003); Marcus A., Baumgartner V., A Practical Set of Culture Dimensions for Global User-Interface Development, LNCS, 3101, pp. 252-261, (2004); Marcus A., Gould E.W., Crosscurrents: Cultural Dimensions and Global Web User-Interface Design.

A sample comprised of 142 teaching professionals working in China, India, and Australia. The results showed that there was a significant relationship between transformational leadership and OCB in China and Australia, but partially in India. Besides, out of the five cultural dimensions, only individualism and uncertainty avoidance significantly varied across the samples from the three countries. There has been inconsistency in researchers' work about the relationship between OCB and transformational leadership in the public sector across the three countries. So, this study attempted to fill this lacuna by studying the relationship between transformational leadership and OCB.","And australia; China; Culture; India; OCB; Transformational leadership","","Ackfeldt A.L., Leonard V.C., A study of organizational citizenship behaviors in a retail setting, Journal of Business Research, 58, 2, pp. 151-159, (2005); Adler N.J., International dimensions of organizational behavior, (2002); Angeline S., Sudha S., Leadership styles affecting organizational citizenship behaviour in selected it organizations in Chennai, Prabandhan: Indian Journal of Management, 7, 4, pp. 28-36, (2014); Avolio B.J., Yammarino F.J., Operationalizing charismatic leadership using a level of analysis framework, Leadership Quarterly, 1, 3, pp. 193-203, (1990); Bass B.M., Leadership &performance beyond expectations, (1985); Bass B.M., Avolio B.J., The multifactor leadership questionnaire-5x short form, (1995); Bass B.M., Steidlmeier P., Ethics character & the authentic transformational leadership behavior, Leadership Quarterly, 10, 2, pp. 181-217, (1999); Bono J.E., Judge T.A., Self-concordance at work: Towards understanding the motivational effects of transformational leaders, Academy of Management Journal, 46, 5, pp. 554-571, (2003); Burns J.M., Leadership, (1978); Chen X.-R., Fahr J.-H., Transformational & transactional leader behaviors in Chinese organizations: Differential effects in the People's Republic of China & Taiwan, Advances in Global Leadership, 2, 1, pp. 101-126, (2001); Dvir T., Dov E., Avolio B., Shamir B., Impact of transformational leadership on follower development & performance: Afield experiment, Academy of Management Journal, 45, 4, pp. 735-744, (2002); Fuller J.B., Patterson C.E.P., Hester K., Stringer D.Y., A quantitative review on charismatic leadership, Psychological Reports, 75, 1, pp. 271-287, (1996); Hater J.J., Bass B.M., Superiors evaluations & subordinate's perceptions of transformational & transactional leadership, Journal of Applied Psychology, 73, 4, pp. 695-702, (1988); Hautala T., The effect of subordinates' personality on appraisals of transformational leadership, Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies, 11, 4, pp. 84-92, (2005); Hofstede G., Culture's consequences: International differences in work-related values (Abridged edition), (1984); Hofstede G., Culture constraints in management theories, Academy of Management Executive, 7, 1, pp. 81-94, (1993); Hofstede G., Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, & organizations across nations, (2001); Humphreys J.H., Einstein W.O., Nothing new under the sun: Transformational leadership from a historical perspective, Management Decision, 41, 1, pp. 85-95, (2003); Johnson S.K., Dipboye R.L., Effects of charismatic content & delivery on follower task performance: The moderating role of task charisma conduciveness, Group & Organization Management, 33, 1, pp. 77-106, (2008); Jorg R., Schyns B., Is similarity in leadership related to organizational outcomes?

Design/methodology/approach - The data are gathered through direct observations, short-time interviews, participative observations, in-depth interviews, and obtaining relevant documentary evidence by the employment of grounded theory. The director, divisional heads, doctors, nursing sisters and nurses, paramedical staff, midwifery staff, clerical staff, and support staff of the hospital are appropriately considered as the informants during the employment of the above data gathering techniques. The data are analyzed qualitatively in line with the research variables. Findings - As cultural characteristics of the hospital, the study identified low power distance, low uncertainty avoidance, low individualism, and low masculinity. The study identified high senior management commitment, high staff commitment, high stakeholder focus, high integration of continuous improvement, high quality culture, high measurement and feedback, and high learning organization characteristics as TQM practices of the hospital. Moreover, the study found that the supportive culture of the hospital has positively impacted on its TQM practices. Research limitations/implications - To overcome the limitations of the OC framework adopted in the present study, the paper invites future studies to examine the issue from a broader and new culture perspective. Originality/value - Recently, many organizations in Sri Lanka irrespective of their category and industry have been practicing TQM in order to stay competitive in both domestic and international markets. But empirical studies on the topic are very limited in the Sri Lankan context. This study as a case of a Sri Lankan public sector hospital aims to fill that gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Hospitals; Organizational culture; Public sector organizations; Sri Lanka; Total quality management","Employment; International trade; Nursing; Quality assurance; Quality control; Societies and institutions; Total quality management; Continuous improvements; Data gathering; Design/methodology/approach; Direct observation; Empirical studies; Grounded theory; High quality; In-depth interviews; In-line; International markets; Learning organizations; Low Power; Organizational cultures; Public sector; Public sector organization; Quality awards; Senior management; Sri Lanka; Support staff; Uncertainty avoidance; Hospitals","Crosby P.B., Quality is Free: The Art of Making Quaity Certain, (1979); Dale B.G., Managing Quality, (1994); Deal T.E., Kennedy A.A., Corporate Cultures, the Rights and Rituals of Corporate Life, (1982); Deming W.E., Out of the Crisis, (1986); Feigenbaum A.V., Total Quality Control, (1991); Glaser B.G., Strauss A.L., The Discovery of Grounded Theory, Strategies for Qualitative Research, (1967); Handy C.B., Understanding Organizations, (1985); Hofstede G., Cultures and Organizations, Software of the Mind, (1991); Ishikawa K., What is Total Quality Control, the Japanese Way, (1985); Johnson G., Rethinking incrementalism, Strategic Management Journal, 9, 1, (1988); Juran J.M., The History of Managing for Quality, the Evolution Trends and Future Directions of Managing for Quality, (1995); Kaye M., Anderson R., Continuous improvements: The ten essential criteria, International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 16, 5, (1998); Kaye M.M., Dyason M.D., The fifth era, The TQM Magazine, 7, 1, (1995); Kroslid D., In Search of Quality Management-rethinking and Reinterpreting, (1999); Lagrosen S., Quality management in Europe: A cultural perspective, The TQM Magazine, 14, 5, (2002); Nanayakkara G., Can Sri Lankans Take the Quality Challenge?

We adopt five cultural dimensions - collectivism/individualism (CI), masculinity/femininity (MASC), power distance (PD), uncertainty avoidance (UA) and fatalism (FT), and relate them to two types of leadership perception modes - recognition-based and inference-based processes, and perceived leadership effectiveness. Propositions are developed concerning how these cultural dimensions would be expected to influence leadership perception processes. We also discuss our propositions from a multidimensional perspective. We propose that in some cultural settings, fitting leadership behaviors and traits to leadership prototypes will be more likely to lead to perceived leadership effectiveness. In other cultural settings, more positive group or organizational performance outcomes will be more likely to lead to perceived leadership effectiveness. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these propositions as they are embedded within an organizational context.

This study examined ambidexterity as a predictor of teams’ perception of their innovation. It also examined the impact of culture-power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, masculinity, and short-term orientation IT teams’ explorative and exploitative behaviors. The results also show that team ambidexterity is a predictor of innovation. Power distance is negatively related to explorative behavior. Collectivist characteristics are positively associated with both explorative and exploitative behaviors. Masculine behavior likewise predict more explorative behavior. The results can guide human resource development efforts geared to foster greater innovation within teams in organizations. © Universidad Alberto Hurtado, Facultad de Economía y Negocios.","Ambidexterity;

Economic indicators included the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, the unemployment rate, and the Gini index. Cultural variables included five Hofstede's cultural dimensions, seven Schwartz cultural value dimensions, NEO-PI-R scales, and the intelligence quotient (IQ). The results showed positive associations between favorable economic conditions (high income per capita, high employment rate, and low income inequality) and high traffic safety. Countries with higher road-traffic accident fatality rates were characterized by higher power distance and uncertainty avoidance as well as embeddedness and emphasis on social hierarchy. Countries with lower road-traffic accident fatality rates were more individualistic, egalitarian, and emphasized autonomy of individuals. Conscientiousness (from NEO-PI-R) and IQ correlated negatively with road-traffic accident fatalities. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2009.","","Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Automobiles; Cross-Cultural Comparison;

Using a sample (n=568) drawn from the banking industry in Finland and Hong Kong, we found that although the effects and predictive capability of culture (i.e. masculinity-femininity, individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance) offered some important insights, a range of other contextual factors (i.e. organizational, institutional, economic) wielded influence over and shaped reward-performance values, preferences, and behaviours. The emergence of these new paradigms necessitates that the US centric economic and behavioural theories (e.g. exchange) that underpin reward-performance be revisited and extended if they are to be applicable in the international context. Understanding the influence of a range of contextual forces is therefore critical to multinational organizations attempting to implement effective reward strategies aimed at achieving a diverse set of performance priorities. In addition to these novel theoretical and practical contributions, this study also paves the way for future research in this promising area of management studies. © 2011 The Authors.

Yet it is interesting to note that the management perspective which Shakespeare seems to espouse has emanated from the cultural ethos of his native country, Great Britain. Britain has been portrayed by prominent interculturists such as Geert Hofstede, Fons Trompenaars, Edward T. Hall as a low power distance, weak uncertainty avoidance, low-context culture with high masculinity and individualism index, demonstrating achievement and inner-directed value orientations. Even Global Leadership and Organizational Behaviour Effectiveness (GLOBE) study in its cultural taxonomy identifies a ramification of Anglo-cluster leadership model with a distinct skill set which includes Great Britain. The character lineaments of Shakespeare's king leaders present congruence with the leadership profiles defined for diverse cultural demarcations by these seminal works on cross-cultural management with remarkable fidelity thereby endorsing the view that culture and leadership are inextricably woven together in a symbiotic engagement. The article applies theories of intercultural management to the leadership, communication and management inferences that can be drawn from the literature of this bard of Avon to reach the conclusion that this master craftsman evinces a strong cultural affiliation to his native country in offering his sagacious exhortations which are designed for an English audience and hence, cannot be transplanted in the Oriental part of the world without indigenizing them in the process of transposition to fit into foreign cultural constructs. Thus, in order to be globally relevant an intercultural reading of Shakespeare has to be practised with systemic mutations in his scripts in order to offer an effective transnational discourse to management practitioners keeping in view the plurality of disparate socio-cultural business contexts. © 2014 Mudra Institute of Communications.","culture; leadership; management; persuasive communication; Shakespeare","","Beamer L., Varner I., Interncultural Communication in the Global Workplace, (2011); Cartelli T., Repositioning Shakespeare: National Formations, Postcolonial Appropriations, (1999); Chaudhuri S., Lim C.S., Shakespeare without English: The Reception of Shakespeare in Non-Anglophone Countries, (2006); Corrigan P., Shakespeare on Management, (1999); Donaldson P.S., About MIT global Shakespeares, (2013); Edelstein B., Bardisms: Shakespeare for All Occasions, (2009); French R., Cross-Cultural Management in Work Organizations, (2007); Hall E., Hall M., Understanding Cultural Differences, (1999); Hofstede G., Motivation, leadership, and organization: Do American theories apply abroad?, Organizational Dynamics, 9, 1, pp. 42-63, (1980); Hofstede G., Culture and Organizations: Software of the Mind, (2003); Kao H.S.R., Sinha D., Wilpert B., Management and Cultural Values-the Indigenization of Organizations in Asia, (1999); Leggatt A., Shakespeare's Political Drama, (1988); Loomba A., Orkin M., Post-Colonial Shakespeares, (1998); Madhavan S., Cross Cultural Management: Concepts and Cases, (2011); Munter M., Guide to Managerial Communication, (2011); Northouse P.G., Culture and Leadership in Leadership Theory and Practice, (2006); Ouchi W.G., Theory: How American Business Can Meet the Japanese Challenge, (1993); Peters T., Thriving on Chaos, (1989); Punnet B.J., International Perspectives on Organizational Behaviour and Human Resource Management, (2004); Ramanujan A.K., Is there an Indian way of thinking?, Contributions to Indian Sociology, 23, 1, pp. 41-58, (1989); Said E., Orientalism, (1977); Times of India, (2013); Trompenaars F., Riding the Waves of Culture-Understanding Cultural Diversity in Business, (1993); Tuleja E.A., Intercultural Communication for Business, (2008); Whitney J.O., Packer T., Power Play, (2000)","A.

By drawing on theoretical antecedents in previous IS and culture studies, this paper examines and analyzes cultural impact on ERP utilization in China. The study involved 25 semi-structured interviews in two Chinese companies. The findings identified that China's cultural features of high power distance, low uncertainty avoidance and collectivism, can originate a set of crucial ERP barriers and problems, which are located in diverse management and organizational areas in Chinese companies. The study suggested that, in order to address these cultural obstacles and thus ensure long-term ERP success, Chinese enterprises need to substantially change their traditional business procedures, staff attitudes, and management behaviour. Given that many cultural factors are not unique to a country, the findings of this study should have applicability beyond China. © 2010 IEEE.","","Business procedures; Chinese companies; Cultural factors;

Design/methodology/approach - Most empirical research on culture dimensions and corruption is based on Hofstede's dataset of culture conducted more than 25 years ago. Evidence from a more recent dataset of culture dimensions is needed before current generalizations can be made. The GLOBE project is based on the perceptions of 18,000 individuals. Findings - The results provide empirical support for the influence of uncertainty avoidance values, human orientation practices, and individual collectivism practices on the level of corruption after controlling for economic and human development, which, in turn, adds to the efforts to build a general theory of the culture perspective of corruption. Research limitations/implications - The findings offer valuable insights on why cultural values and cultural practices should be distinguished as they relate to corruption. Practical implications - International policy makers as well as managers at multinational corporations can benefit from the findings of this research study. Originality/value - The research reported is among the first to investigate the issue of corruption from the perspective of national cultural values and practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corruption; Cross-cultural studies; Culture","","Ashkanasy N., Gupta V., Mayfield M., Roberts E., Future orientation, Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Ashour A., ""Combating Corruption: Systemic and Strategic Perspectives"", (2006); Bagchi K., Hart P., Peterson M.F., National culture and information technology product adoption, Journal of Global Information Technology, 7, 4, pp. 29-46, (2004); Bontis N., National intellectual capital index: A United Nations initiative for the Arab region, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 5, 1, pp. 13-39, (2004); Carl D., Gupta V., Javidan M., Power distance, Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Chonko L.B., Hunt S.D., Ethics and marketing management: An empirical examination, Journal of Business Research, 13, pp. 339-359, (1985); Davis J.H., Ruhe J., Perceptions of country corruption: Antecedents and outcomes, Journal of Business Ethics, 43, 4, pp. 275-288, (2003); Den Hartog D., Assertiveness, Culture, Leadership, and Organizations: The GLOBE Study of 62 Societies, (2004); Dollar D., Fisman R., Gatti R., Are women really the 'fairer' sex?

This suggests that an underlying theme focuses on how CEO compensation is related to instrumental choices made in a competitive, capitalist culture. This study seeks to expand the understanding of CEO compensation by examining it in the context of other cultures, based on the premise that national culture plays a significant part in the nature of compensation strategies. We relate cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism, and masculinity-femininity) developed by Hofstede (Hofstede 1980a, 2001) to several dimensions of CEO compensation. These dimensions are total CEO pay, the proportion of variable pay to total compensation, and the ratio of CEO pay to the lowest level employees. The main findings of our paper are (1) all of the different dimensions of CEO pay were related to power distance, leading us to infer that CEO pay in a culture is most reflective of the strength of the power structure in a society, and (2) total compensation and the ratio of variable pay to total pay are related to individualism. We conclude that cultural dimensions can contribute to understanding cross-national CEO compensation. The implication of this conclusion is that there are different ways that CEO compensation fits into the cognitive schema of various cultures and, furthermore, that these cognitive schema vary across societies that affect the nature of the ""cultural matrix into which [money] is incorporated"" (Bloch and Parry 1989, p. 1). Moreover, our results imply that particular forms of CEO compensation do not mean the same thing in different cultures, but rather carry different symbolic connotations depending on the values dominant in a society. Thus, not only does the compensation structure of a firm within a culture have a symbolic meaning within organizations (e.g., Trice and Beyer 1993), but it can also be seen as an expression of deeper social values (Hofstede et al. 1990) that may differ across countries.","CEO compensation; Culture; Hofstede","","Abowd J.M., Bognanno M.L., International differences in executive and managerial compensation, Differences and Changes in Wage Structures, pp. 67-103, (1995); Adler N.J., International Dimensions of Organizational Behavior, 3rd Ed., (1997); Aggarwal R.K., Samwick A.A., The other side of the trade-off: The impact of risk on executive compensation, J.

Two of the more important cultural factors which affects IT transfer are power distance and uncertainty avoidance. The IT expert, by virtue of specialized knowledge is in a position of power. The user of information technology may or may not accept the authority of the IT professional. When the user and the expert is in agreement on the issue of power-distance the IT systems provided will be viewed in a more positive light. This hypothesis is tested and confirmed in the present study. A list of twelve statements expressing special IT knowledge and authority was constructed and a sample of IT experts and users were asked to rate their level of agreement with these on a scale 0 to 5. The simple sum of respondent rating was used as a measure of acceptance of IT authority and power. Users were also asked to rate their level of satisfaction with the progress of a new Hospital Information System been implemented. The IT acceptance score of users who were satisfied with implementation progress did not differ from IT personnel but differed significantly from users who were not satisfied with progress.

To contribute to our understanding of the factors driving this diffusion, I study relationships between national values (measured by Hofstede's cultural dimensions) and renewable electricity adoption at the national level. Existing data for 66 nations (representing an equal number of developed and developing economies) are used to fuel the analysis. Somewhat dependent on limited available data on controls for grid reliability and the cost of electricity, I discover that three of Hofstede's dimensions (high uncertainty avoidance, low masculinity-femininity, and high individualism-collectivism) have significant exponential relationships with renewable electricity adoption. The dimension of uncertainty avoidance appears particularly appropriate for practical application. Projects or organizations implementing renewable electricity policy, designs, or construction should particularly attend to this cultural dimension. In particular, as the data imply that renewable technologies are being used to manage risk in electricity supply, geographies with unreliable grids are particularly likely to be open to renewable electricity technologies. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","","Culture; Electricity; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Renewable Energy; Uncertainty; Climate change; Economics; Energy policy; Cost of electricity; Developing economies; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Individualism collectivisms; Renewable electricity; Renewable electricity policies; Renewable technology; Uncertainty avoidance; climate change; cost analysis; economic development; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy policy; environmental economics; global perspective; infrastructural development; renewable resource; risk assessment; technological change; valuation; adoption; avoidance behavior; climate change; diffusion; economic aspect; electricity; femininity; geography; individuality; masculinity; organization; reliability; uncertainty; cultural anthropology; economics; electricity; human; renewable energy; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Electric power transmission networks","World Bank, Electricityproduction from Renewable Sources,excluding Hydroelectric (% of Total) | Data | Table; Rogers E.M., Diffusion of Innovations, (2003); Miller D., Selling Solar: The Diffusion of Renewable Energy in Emerging Markets, (2009); Hu Y., Cheng H., Development and Bottlenecks of Renewable Electricity Generation in China: A Critical Review, Environ.

A theoretical framework to ascertain lecturers' intentions to use mobile wireless technology during lectures (dependent variable) is proposed with seven independent variables. The independent variables were ease of use and usefulness from Technology Acceptance Model; trust from Wireless Internet via Mobile Devices model and Mobile Services Acceptance Model; self-efficacy from Social Cognitive Theory; enjoyment from Motivational Model; social influence from Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology; and uncertainty avoidance from Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Hofstede et al. in Cultures and organizations: software of the mind, 3rd edn. McGraw-Hill, New York, 2010). Four lecture observations were conducted and interaction barriers identified. Interviews with 22 selected lecturers were conducted to elicit perceptions of mobile wireless technology use during lectures and validate the framework's variables. Interview results from thematic analysis strongly validated mobile wireless technology's usefulness as a supporting, collaboration and real-time interaction tool, especially among introvert students. Ease of use, self-efficacy and enjoyment are supported through familiarity with mobile wireless technology. Majority of the respondents are apprehensive that mobile wireless technology might cause disruptions during lectures, with concerns of redundancy, dependency and misuses amongst students (attributes of uncertainty avoidance). None of the respondents are currently using mobile wireless technology for interaction during lectures, thus lending credence to social influence. Very few respondents agree that use of mobile wireless technology can reduce students' boredom and make lectures more enjoyable, and few perceive intermittent wireless connection will affect user trust. Knowledge of significant mobile wireless technology adoption factors and concerns may be important and applicable to tertiary education in Malaysia. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Interactive lectures; Interactivity; Mobile wireless technology; Technology acceptance models; Uncertainty avoidance","","Adams D., Nelson R., Todd P., Perceived usefulness, ease of use and usage of information technology: A replication, MIS Quarterly, 16, 2, pp. 227-247, (1992); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, pp. 179-211, (1991); Allen D., Tanner K., Infusing active learning into the large-enrollment biology class: Seven strategies, from the simple to complex, Cell Biology Education, 4, 4, pp. 262-268, (2005); Alzaza N.S., Yaakub A.R., Students' awareness and requirements of mobile learning services in the higher education environment, American Journal of Economics and Business Administration, 3, 1, pp. 95-100, (2011); Bandura A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change, Psychological Review, 84, 2, pp. 191-215, (1977); Bandura A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective, Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 1-26, (2001); Bandyopadhyay K., Fraccastoro K.A., The effect of culture on user acceptance of information technology, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 19, 522-543, (2007); Beekes W., The 'Millionaire' method for encouraging participation, Active Learning in Higher Education, 7, 1, pp. 25-36, (2006); Berg B.L., Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Science, (2000); Bryman A., Burgess R.G., Qualitative Research: Sage Publication, (1998); Cheng D., Liu G., Song Y.F., Qian C., Adoption of Internet banking: An integrated model.

Design/methodology/approach - Logistic regression analysis based on 440 observations of home-target country dyads collected from websites of nine European airlines, and supplemented by additional sources of macro level indicators. The unit of analysis is the country dyad. Findings - Cultural distance between home and target country, geographical distance between home and target country, website traffic volumes originating from target country, demand conditions in target country, and competition intensity in target country all influence the decision to launch local sites. The cultural dimensions of individualism, masculinity, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance, as well as the legal, commercial and IT infrastructures in target countries don't impact the same decision. Research limitations/implications - The study's findings are limited contextually to B2C e-service models, the airline industry and the European origin. Other industries, business models or regional origin of firms may exhibit different patterns. Originality/value - The study shifts the research focus from what constitutes website localization into what dictates localization efforts' implementation. Surprising findings suggest that counter to earlier suggestions, infrastructural conditions and cultural dimensions' levels in target markets do not predict the launch of local sites, and that geographical distance impact decisions related to the geography neutral medium of the internet.

In this context, a tragic event - the Xiaolin Village incident - which occurred during Typhoon Morakot in 2009, a mudslide buried the entire village killing 491 residents in all. This put Taiwans disaster management system to the test. It failed to demonstrate a convincing emergency response. This shock disclosed the misalignment between the disaster management system and de facto interpersonal interactions under the system and pointedly revealed a crucial operational problem in the disjuncture between the system and the government agents. In this paper, Hofstedes cultural dimensions (specifically, power distance and uncertainty avoidance) are employed to explore the influence of culture on the operation of the system. Thirty-two governmental officials were interviewed and their styles of handling conflict assessed using Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument. The cultural influence is appraised by detecting the shift of their styles under the emergency situation. Our findings expose the cultural cognitive constraints imposed on individuals by the system and help explain why the actual reactions to the Xiaolin Village incident differed greatly from the expected response. © 2014 Copyright The Chinese Institute of Engineers.","disaster management; emergency response; natural disaster; Typhoon Morakot","Disaster prevention; Hurricanes; Rural areas; Disaster management; Emergency response; Human-system interaction; Natural disasters; Operational problems; Organizational system; Typhoon Morakot; Uncertainty avoidance; Emergency services","Augustine N.R., Managing the crisis you tried to prevent, Harvard Business Review, 73, 6, pp. 147-158, (1995); Blake R.R., Mouton J.S., The Managerial Grid: The Key to Leadership Excellence, (1964); Typhoon Morakot Disaster Responses Reports (2009.08.06-2009.09.08), (2009); Chan H., Collective effects of strategic, cultural and institutional factors on investors?

Samples from a total of 10 regions in the US, Canada and Mexico increased the accuracy and meaningfulness of the findings. Hofstede's cultural dimensions uncertainty avoidance and power distance had the most consistent and significant relationship to propensity for both whistle-blowing and internal reporting, while collectivism was not found to be significantly related to either ethics management tool. Managers who better understand the cultural links to ethics management are more likely to craft the most effective organizational ethics strategies. Researchers can gain from increased insight, allowing departure from assumptions to an empirically based examination of how cultural dimensions might influence ethics management instruments.

The relative prevalence of these two subtypes varies dramatically between countries, but no explanation of this variability has yet been proposed. This study examined the hypothesis that the prevalence of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism, relative to homosexual MtF transsexualism, would be higher in individualistic countries than in collectivistic countries. I analyzed data from 22 studies of MtF transsexualism, conducted in 16 countries, examining the association between percentage of nonhomosexual participants and Hofstede's (Culture's consequences: Comparing values, behaviors, institutions, and organizations across nations, 2001) Individualism Index (IDV). IDV accounted for 77% of observed variance in the percentage of nonhomosexual MtF participants (r = 0.88, p < .0001). Controlling for differences in national wealth and in Hofstede's other indices of societal values (Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Masculinity) did not significantly change the ability of IDV to account for variance in the percentage of nonhomosexual participants. The factors that contribute to the observed association between societal individualism and the relative prevalence of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism remain to be determined, but a greater tolerance within individualistic countries for socially disruptive gender transitions by nonhomosexual gender dysphoric men, and the availability within many collectivistic countries of socially approved transgender roles for pervasively feminine homosexual gender dysphoric men, are plausible contributors. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Collectivism;

In other words, for more effective knowledge sharing, communication competence is required in order to have appropriate conversation. During the past decades, most theories of communication competence have been developed on the basis of ""western"" conceptualization. This empirical research is conducted in order to study the organizational communication competence in a non-western country, Vietnam, and the effect of such competence to the employees' knowledge sharing behavior respectively. Base on the data collected from 11 organizations, the effects of three culture dimensions, namely individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance to the communication competence were statistically analyzed; then, stemming from the certain level of communication competence, the behavior of organizational members towards knowledge sharing was explained.","Communication competence; Knowledge sharing; National culture;

Recently, the role accountability plays in organizational decision making has received attention in the literature. Accountability, defined as the pressure to justify one’s decisions to others (Tetlock 1983), is a fact of organizational life and should be incorporated into the research on organizational decision making. However, while these studies shed light on the real-world context in which organizational decision makers decide, they generally ignore the influence of culture on accountability and its outcomes. This presents a serious limitation since the specific norms, values, and ideologies to which people are held accountable differ dramatically from one culture to the next. Therefore, what is considered a socially acceptable justification for behavior likely depends on social contextual factors such as “cultural system” ideologies (Tetlock 1985, p. 308). In other words, the steps decision makers take to cope with demands for accountability may depend upon cultural factors. © 2015, The Academy of Marketing Science.","High Power Distance; Information Search; Organizational Buyer; Social Loafing; Uncertainty Avoidance","","Doney P.M., The Effects of Accountability on Information Search and Analysis by Organizational Buyers, Proceedings. 21St Albert Haring Symposium, pp. 165-185, (1991); Doney P.M., The Effects of Accountability on Symbolic Search and Information Analysis by Organizational Buyers, (1992); Douglas S.P., Wind Y., The Myth of Globalization, Columbia Journal of World Business, 22, 1, pp. 19-29, (1987); Earley P.C., Social Loafing and Collectivism, pp. 565-581, (1989); Hall E.T., Hall M.R., Understanding Cultural Differences, (1990); Hofstede G., The Cultural Relativity of Organizational Practices and Theories, Journal of International Business Studies, 14, 3, pp. 75-89, (1983); Levitt T., The Globalization ofMarkets, Harvard Business Review, 6l, May June, pp. 92-102, (1983); Maddox R.C., Short D., The Cultural Integrator, Business Horizons, 31, 6, pp. 51-59, (1988); Reeder J.A., When West Meets East: Cultural Aspects of Doing Business in Asia, Business Horizons, 30, 1, pp. 69-74, (1987); Sekely W.S., Collins J.M., Cultural Influences on International Capital Structure, Journal Oflnternational Business Studies, 19, 1, pp. 87-100, (1988); Tetlock P.E., Accountability and the Complexity ofThought, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 45, 1, pp. 74-83, (1983); Tetlock P.E., Toward An Intuitive Politician Model of Attribution Processes, The Self and Social Life, Barry R.

However, these doctors encounter many cultural differences, in relation to training, the healthcare system and the doctor-patient relationship and training. Aim: To examine whether Hofstede's cultural model may help us understand the changes doctors from other countries experience on coming to work in the UK, and to identify implications for supervisors and clinical teams. Method: Telephone interviews were conducted with overseas medical graduates before starting work as a Foundation Year One (F1) doctor, followed up after four months and 12 months; and with educational supervisors. Data were analysed using a confirmatory thematic approach. Results: Sixty-four initial interviews were conducted with overseas doctors, 56 after four months, and 32 after 12 months. Twelve interviews were conducted with educational supervisors. The changes doctors experienced related particularly to Hofstede's dimensions of power distance (e.g. in relation to workplace hierarchies and inter-professional relationships), uncertainty avoidance (e.g. regarding ways of interacting) and individualism-collectivism (e.g., regarding doctor-patient/family relationship; assertiveness of individuals). Conclusion: Hofstede's cultural dimensions may help us understand the adaptations some doctors have to make in adjusting to working in the UK NHS. This may promote awareness and understanding and greater 'cultural competence' amongst those working with them or supervising them in their training. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.","","Culture; Education, Medical; Foreign Medical Graduates; Gender Identity; Great Britain; Humans; Physician-Patient Relations; Power (Psychology); State Medicine; Uncertainty; article; behavior; cultural anthropology; doctor patient relation; foreign worker; gender identity; human; medical education; national health service; organization and management; psychological aspect; uncertainty; United Kingdom; foreign worker; psychology","Bates J., Andrew R., Untangling the roots of some imgs' poor academic performance, Commentary.

This study is part of the project named ""Managerial Behaviour in Romanian Organizations"", which is a wide explanatory research made by The Romanian Scientific Society of Management. We took into consideration various domains of economic activity and organizations from all over the country. The main objective of our paper is to analyze Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) as national cultural dimension. We tested UA in Romanian organizations. The research covers the period 2008-2012. The cultural dimension under this research emphasizes the preference for strict laws and regulations over ambiguity and risk. This hypothesis was validated in this study. The results, corroborated with others, will be used for international comparison, so as to elaborate the Romanian pattern of organizational culture and managerial behavior.","Culture; Management; Uncertainty avoidance","","Chelcea S., Methodology of Sociological Research, pp. 110-117, (2007); Earley P.C., Leading cultural research in the future: A matter of paradigms and taste, Journal of International Business Studies, 37, 6, pp. 922-931, (2006); Erdem T., Swait J., Valenzuela A., Brands as signals: A cross-country validation study, Journal of Marketing, 70, 1, pp. 34-48, (2006); Griffith D.A., Cavusgil S.T., Xu S., Emerging themes in international business research, Journal of International Business Studies, 39, 7, pp. 1220-1235, (2008); Grove C.N., Introduction to the GLOBE Research Project on Leadership Worldwide, (2005); Grove C.N., Worldwide Differences in Business Values and Practices: Overview of GLOBE Research Findings, (2005); Hofstede G., Cultural Dimensions; Hofstede G., Culture's Consequences: Comparing Values, Behaviors, Institutions and Organizations Across Nations, (2001); Hofstede G.J., Pedersen P., Hofstede G., Exploring Culture: Exercises, Stories and Synthetic Cultures, (2002); Hofstede G., Hofstede G.J., Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, (2005); Hofstede G., What did GLOBE really measure?

While there have been many reports about the positive outcomes of proactivity, there is much less known about the antecedents, particularly those related to culture. Design/methodology/approach: Sales employees (n=147) in a multi-national organization from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA were surveyed to assess the impact of cultural trait influences on proactive behavior at the individual level. Using linear regression and partial least squares structural equation modeling, three independent variables were found to be significant antecedents to proactive behavior. Findings: Long-term orientation positively influenced proactive behaviors as did uncertainty avoidance. Uncertainty avoidance was hypothesized to have a negative impact on proactive behaviors, but the results of this study implied that individuals found it safer to adjust to a fluid environment rather than to remain inflexible. No relationship was found between power distance and proactivity. Masculinity was found to be positively related to proactive behaviors but collectivism was not. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study should be limited to its own population and not generalized to larger, more culturally diverse populations which were not represented in the sample. Practical implications: This study provides better understanding of managerial proactive behavior related to cultural traits, particularly in the domain of field sales. Originality/value: This study is unique in that it explores individual proactivity in an organizational selling environment related to cultural traits at the individual level. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cultural traits;

Barczak and Sultan, 2006), but increasing (Cooper, 2007). Extant research indicates that several factors influence IT usage, including the existence of a champion and NPD process formalization (Barczak, Sultan, and Hultink, 2007; Barczak, Hultink, and Sultan, 2008). In addition, the antecedents to IT usage have been found to vary among countries (Barczak, Hultink, and Sultan, 2008); that is, they are context-specific. This study extends prior research by exploring the factors that facilitate and/or inhibit IT usage for NPD in Japanese firms. Japan was chosen for this study because it has been argued that, in order to develop generalized NPD theories applicable across different nations or cultures, further understanding is needed about countries other than North American and Western European countries (Song and Parry, 1996; Song, Kawakami, and Stringfellow, 2010). Additionally, the culture of Japan is known for being very different from North America and other Western countries, particularly in terms of Japan's relative emphasis on the collective as opposed to the individual; high in uncertainty avoidance as opposed to low uncertainty avoidance; and long-term orientation rather than short-term orientation (Hofstede, 2005; Kawakami, Maclachlan, and Stringfellow, forthcoming). The lack of research in Japan on IT and NPD implied the need for an exploratory, grounded theory approach to this study. Using a multiple case study method, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 marketing, R&D, and IT managers and executives in 19 firms in a variety of industries. Based on the analysis of the interview data and the follow-up surveys, the authors propose that ten factors in five categories, namely, strategic factors, market environment factors, development process factors, organizational factors, and technology-human interaction factors, are likely to influence IT usage for NPD in Japanese companies. Specifically, product innovativeness, extent of global engagement, formalized IT ROI measure, standardization of NPD activities, physical proximity, resistance to change, CIO as an executive sponsor, sensory requirements, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness are expected to influence IT usage. From a theoretical perspective, this study extends prior research on IT usage by expanding the cultural context beyond North America and Western Europe by focusing on an Asian country, namely Japan. It also adds to the limited research that integrates national culture and NPD and enables the development of a conceptual model that could be tested empirically. © 2011 Product Development & Management Association.","","Product development; Research; Asian countries; Conceptual model; Cultural context; Development process; European Countries; Grounded theory approach; Innovativeness; Interaction factor; Japanese company; Japanese firms; Long-term orientation; Market environment; Multiple-case study; National cultures; New product development; North American; Organizational factors; Perceived ease of use; Perceived usefulness; Physical proximity; Process formalizations; Resistance to change; Semi structured interviews; Strategic factors; Uncertainty avoidance; Western countries; Western Europe; Information technology","Akgun A.E., Lynn G., New product development team improvisation and speed-to-market, European Journal of Innovation Management, 5, 3, pp. 117-129, (2002); Barczak G., Sultan F., The usage of information technology in the NPD process: An exploratory study, Proceedings of the 12th International Product Development and Management Conference, (2005); Barczak G., Sultan F., Use IT or lose it, Marketing Management, 15, 2, pp. 30-34, (2006); Barczak G., Hultink E.J., Sultan F., Antecedents and consequences of information technology usage in NPD, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 25, 6, pp. 620-631, (2008); Barczak G., Sultan F., Hultink E.J., Determinants of IT usage and new product performance, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 24, 6, pp. 600-613, (2007); Bostrom R., Heinen J.S., MIS problems and failures, MIS Quarterly, 1, 3, pp. 17-32, (1977); Boynton A.C., Zmud R.W., Jacobs G.C., The influence of IT management practice on IT use in large organizations, MIS Quarterly, 18, 3, pp. 299-318, (1994); Chen C., Chieu S., Structure of business organization and traditional family system, Chinese Management, (1984); Cooper R.G., The Thought Column with Bob Cooper, (2007); Davis F.D., Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Davis F.D., Bagozzi R., Warshaw P.R., User acceptance of computer technology, Management Science, 35, 8, pp. 982-1003, (1989); Devaraj S., Kohli R., Performance impacts of information technology, Management Science, 49, 3, pp. 273-289, (2003); Dodgson M., Gann D., Salter A., The role of technology in the shift towards open innovation, R&D Management, 36, 3, pp. 333-346, (2006); Durmusoglu S., Barczak G., The use of information technology tools in new product development phases, Industrial Marketing Management, 40, 2, pp. 321-330, (2011); Durmusoglu S.S., Calantone R.J., Sambamurthy V., Is more information technology better for new product development?, Journal of Product and Brand Management, 15, 7, pp. 435-441, (2006); Eisenhardt K.M., Building theories from case study research, The Academy of Management Review, 14, 4, pp. 532-550, (1989); Garcia R., Calantone R., A critical look at technological innovation typology and innovativeness terminology: A literature review, Journal of Product Innovation Management, 19, 2, pp. 110-132, (2002); Glaser B., Strauss A., The Discovery of Grounded Theory, (1967); Grover V., Seung-Ryul J., Kettinger W.J., Lee C.C., The chief information officer, Journal of Management Information Systems, 10, 2, pp. 107-130, (1993); Henard D.H., Szymanski D.M., Why some new products are more successful than others, Journal of Marketing Research, 38, 3, pp. 362-375, (2001); Hofstede G., Cultural constraints in management theories, Academy of Management Executive, 7, 1, pp. 81-94, (1993); Hofstede G., Cultures and Organizations, (2005); Johansson J.K., Nonaka I., Market research the Japanese way, Harvard Business Review, 65, 3, pp. 16-19, (1987); Kawakami T., MacLachlan D.L., Stringfellow A., New venture performance in China, Japan and the United States, Journal of Product Innovation Management; Miner A.S., Bassoff P., Moorman C., Organizational improvisation and learning, Administrative Science Quarterly, 46, 2, pp. 304-339, (2001); Montoya M.M., Massey A.P., Caisy Hung Y., Crisp C.B., Can you hear me now?

Given the widely recognized effect of cultural values on adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), this study, applying Hofstede's multidimensional framework, investigated the effect of cultural values on the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption in micro level. The empirical examination of the research model indicated that the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption is determined directly by five internal beliefs, including perceived needs, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, perceived resources, and perceived image. The results provide supporting empirical evidence linking most of Hofstede's cultural dimensions to behavioral intention to household Internet adoption. With the exception of power distance, the results showed that collectivism (low individualism), masculinity, long-term orientation, and uncertainty avoidance had significant effects on the behavioral intention to household Internet adoption. The results demonstrated differences in the driving forces and cultural impact on Internet adoption between households and organizations settings. © 2013, IGI Global.","","Empirical examination; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Household internet adoptions; Information and Communication Technologies; Long-term orientation; Multidimensional framework; Perceived ease of use; Uncertainty avoidance; Internet","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Akour I., Alshare K., Miller D., Dwairi M., An exploratory analysis of culture, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and internet acceptance: The case of Jordan, Journal of Internet Commerce, 5, 3, pp. 83-108, (2006); Albirini A., Cultural perceptions: The missing element in the implementation of ICT in developing countries, International Journal of Education and Development Using Information and Communication Technology, 2, 1, pp. 49-65, (2006); Anandarajan M., Igbariam M., Anakwe U.P., IT acceptance in a less-developed country: A motivational factor perspective, International Journal of Information Management, 22, 1, pp. 47-65, (2002); Anderson A., Risk, terrorism, and the Internet, Knowledge.

This paper investigates two competing theories explaining stability versus flexibility in 40 German business students, 51 U.S. business students, and 66 U.S. psychology students. Following cross-cultural psychological research, German students should have higher levels of uncertainty avoidance (Hofstede, 2001), more intolerant of ambiguities, and less flexible in their decisions when compared to their U.S. business and psychology counterparts. Following research on expertise and the deliberate practice theory (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Römer, 1993), German and U.S. business students should show more flexible strategies when compared to the U.S. psychology student novices. Participants took the role of managers in the computer-simulated company CHOCO FINE and worked on 24 simulated months of the simulation individually over a period of 2 hours. Surprisingly, the German sample was actually less intolerant of ambiguity than the two U.S. samples. Uncertainty avoidance and intolerance of ambiguity did not predict DDM intensity or flexibility. Results showed crosscultural differences but no differences between novices and experts. © 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptability; Change; Complex problem solving; Cross-cultural differences; Culture; Dynamic decision making; Flexibility; Growth mixture modeling; Intolerance of ambiguity; Stability; Strategy; Uncertainty avoidance","","Ayoun B.M., Moreo P.J., The influence of the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance on business strategy development: A cross-national study of hotel managers, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 27, pp. 65-75, (2008); Brinckmann J., Grichnik D., Kapsa D., Should entrepreneurs plan or just storm the castle?
